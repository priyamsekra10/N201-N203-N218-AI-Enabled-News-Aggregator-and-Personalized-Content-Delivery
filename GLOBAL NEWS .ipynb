       "  'Content': 'Although previous guises as a journalist, author and rock concert broadcaster may seem far removed from the comparatively dour world of corporate consulting, Mr Barnes says his skills from former careers are applied “every day” in the corporate world.“The ability to write, communicate, think on your feet, ask the right questions and keep drilling down [in important meetings]. That’s all part of what we do. It’s exactly the same skill set as journalism,” he said.Five new partnersBarnes is one of five new partners at advisory and restructuring firm McGrathNicol. Chairman Jason Preston said “the most complex business environment we’ve seen in decades” had driven a surge in restructuring business, and despite the “tougher economic environment”, the mergers and acquisitions, and government advisory sections of the firm remained strong.“We’re also seeing increased demand for cybersecurity work, and even though there’s less capital available, we’re still seeing clients looking to broaden out their businesses and add scale.“It’s still really active. It’s just a more complicated economic environment than it has been in the last few years,” Preston said.AdvertisementThe appointment of five new partners is on par with promotions at the end of the previous two financial years, and brings the total partnership to 53.Imran Pasha is one of the new partners in the firm’s advisory business. A former auditor at the Australian National Audit Office, Mr Pasha has also spent time at KPMG and EY. Joining the firm in August 2021, Pasha specialises in providing internal audit services and financial analysis to government departments and agencies. He is based in Canberra.Nathan Baird is another new partner in the advisory business. A corporate advisory expert, Mr Baird has worked in the firm’s transactions department for the past six years, specialising in mergers and acquisitions. He is based in Sydney.Damien Pasfield has been promoted within McGrathNicol’s restructuring department. He has worked at the firm for almost two decades, specialising in insolvency matters across a range of industries. Before joining the firm, the Sydneysider worked in mid-market advisory at KPMG.Brendan Payne begins as a partner in the advisory business after spending more than a decade at the firm. A digital forensics and eDiscovery expert, Mr Payne spent five years in forensic technology at KPMG. He is based in Perth.'},\n",

       "  'Content': 'CALGARY - Canada’s top technical authority on cybersecurity is working closely with Suncor Energy Inc. in the aftermath of a high-profile systems breach at the oil and gas giant.The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security — which leads Canada’s federal response to cybersecurity incidents — said Wednesday it can’t disclose details of the cybersecurity incident that caused payment systems at many of Suncor’s Petro-Canada locations across the country to go down last week.Sami Khoury, head of the centre, said Suncor is still working to mitigate the damage, and sharing information too soon may compromise those efforts.“We have reached out to Suncor and we are working with them, and we are sharing information with the rest of the (oil and gas) sector to better protect themselves,“ Khoury told reporters in a media briefing.“But at this point the mitigation is still ongoing, and I am unable to provide additional details about the nature of the incident.”Suncor, one of Canada’s largest oil and gas firms, issued a news release a week and a half ago to say that it had “experienced a cybersecurity incident.’’The confirmation followed days of public speculation and complaints on social media from customers unable to use credit or debit cards at the company’s chain of Petro-Canada gas stations in multiple major Canadian cities, or access car wash services.Suncor has not provided details about the type of cyberattack that occurred or whether any of its other operations were affected. As of late last week, the company’s Petro-Canada payment systems had largely been restored.The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security is part of the federal Communications Security Establishment, which provides the government of Canada with information technology security and foreign signals intelligence.It has been warning for years that Canada’s energy sector is an attractive target for cybercriminals. In fact, just days before the Suncor security breach was made public, the centre published a report on the cyber threat facing the country’s oil and gas industry.Khoury said the report’s release had been planned for months, and its timing with relation to the Suncor cyberattack was purely coincidental. He said its message — that the oil and gas sector attracts “more than its share” of attention from cybercriminals — is important for the industry as a whole to hear.He added that in addition to the report, the Centre for Cyber Security also recently hosted a briefing for high-level senior executives within the energy industry.“By and large, companies are mindful of the cybersecurity threat and are putting investments in place to mitigate it, but it’s important to recognize that the threat is constantly evolving, and those investments need to keep up,“ Khoury said.“It’s not a one-time solution.”The Centre for Cyber Security says Canada’s oil and gas sector is an attractive target because of the high value of the industry’s assets and “the degree of customer dependence on the industry’s products.”Ransomware attacks, conducted by cybercriminals motivated purely by financial gain, are by far the likeliest type of cyber threat oil and gas companies face, Khoury said. In recent years, ransomware attacks have grown significantly in both volume and sophistication.In 2021, a ransomware attack successfully targeted the Colonial Pipeline, the largest pipeline system for refined oil products in the U.S. It was the largest cyberattack on oil infrastructure in the history of the United States, and forced the company to temporarily halt pipeline operations.State-sponsored or state-aligned cybercriminals — including those with ties to Russia, China, North Korea and Iran — also pose a risk to the sector, Khoury said. An cyberattack of this type would likely be for the purpose of industrial sabotage or espionage.Khoury said a state-sponsored cyberattack aimed at disrupting the flow of oil and gas in this country is highly unlikely, except in the case of outright hostilities between Canada and another nation.“But the threat is real, and critical infrastructure providers must prepare for it,” he said.Statistics Canada survey data shows about 25 per cent of Canadian oil and gas companies reported a cyber “incident” in 2019, the highest proportion of any critical infrastructure sector.Some experts have said the Suncor systems breach will likely cost the company millions of dollars before it is resolved.According to a report by IBM, the global average cost to companies of a data breach hit an all-time high in 2022 of US$4.35 million, a 13 per cent increase from 2020.In the United States, the average cost to companies of a data breach in 2022 was US$9.44 million.This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 5, 2023.Companies in this story: (TSX:SU)Read more about:SHARE:'},\n",

       "  'Content': 'Join top executives in San Francisco on July 11-12 and learn how business leaders are getting ahead of the generative AI revolution. Learn MoreHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.Attackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.Healthcare must build on cloud security with zero trustForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.What’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.Event Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register NowThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.The HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.Considered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.Lessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.Improving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023Turning weaknesses into strengths with zero trustForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.In fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.Forrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”Every healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threatsThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.The first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).Second, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.Proliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.To understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.Another brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”Two high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer serviceHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.DeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.IoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battleMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.Absolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.A core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.Protecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priorityHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.Telesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction. He told VentureBeat that customers could gain reassurance from friction that a brand, company or healthcare provider has an advanced understanding of cybersecurity and, most importantly, of the importance of protecting patient data and privacy.'},\n",

       "  'Content': 'Imagine a home filled with sophisticated locks, closed-circuit television cameras and a state-of-the-art security system. Yet the owner leaves the back door wide open.This is precisely what’s happening in the world of corporate cybersecurity. As organizations fret over the potential risks of remote work, new research suggests the real dangers lurk within the office itself, according to the findings of a groundbreaking study by the Farmer School of Business at Miami University (forthcoming in the July issue of the peer-reviewed journal Computers & Security).The researchers discovered that remote workers exhibit a higher level of cybersecurity awareness and take more security-related precautions than their in-office counterparts. That’s right, working from home apparently makes employees more vigilant when it comes to cybersecurity.“When we surveyed remote workers, we expected the results to reveal cybersecurity complacency. But surprisingly, the survey revealed remote cyber-vigilance,” the study’s author, Joseph K. Nwankpa, told me.This surprising outcome can be attributed to the so-called “Peltzman effect” and the complacency framework, which the study draws on to explore how remote work may trigger a moral hazard regarding employee cybersecurity awareness and security-based precaution-taking.Remote employees tend to feel a heightened sense of responsibility for their own cybersecurity, while office workers often become complacent, trusting their companies to handle cyberthreats on their behalf.Imagine being on a cruise ship with an impeccable safety record. You might feel so secure that you skip the safety drill and neglect to learn the location of the lifeboats. This is the complacency effect in action. Office workers, surrounded by the perceived safety of their company’s cybersecurity measures, may be less likely to follow best practices and take necessary precautions.The study cites prior research that reveals how employees working within the corporate office and boundaries trust their firms to develop, maintain and update security countermeasures to mitigate cybersecurity threats and risks. As a result, these employees are not apt or mindful of security threats and concerns, leading to constrained cybersecurity awareness.On the other hand, remote workers, like sailors navigating stormy seas, understand that they must be constantly vigilant. This heightened awareness leads them to take more security-based precautions, ultimately keeping their company’s digital assets safer.Indeed, the human element of security is enhanced through a switch to remote work.“Our study found that working from the office within corporate firewalls and security boundaries induced employees to exhibit risky cybersecurity behaviour, such as diminished cybersecurity awareness and precaution-taking,” Nwankpa said. But, “switching to remote work made employees feel insecure, leading to heightened cybersecurity awareness and cybersecurity precautionary measures.”The research model used in the study examined the impact of remote work on security-based precaution-taking and the role of cybersecurity awareness in the relationship between remote work and security-based precaution-taking. The data collected from 203 remote workers across the U.S. provided strong support for the research model, indicating that remote work is positively associated with cybersecurity awareness and security-based precaution-taking.Furthermore, the study revealed that as remote workers gain cybersecurity awareness, they are more likely to apply security-based precaution measures. This reinforces the idea that fostering cybersecurity awareness among remote workers can lead to better protection of organizational information assets against threats.Contrary to popular belief, the findings of this study demonstrate that remote work can actually improve cybersecurity. Companies can leverage this knowledge to their advantage, promoting remote-work arrangements and fostering a culture of vigilance and cybersecurity responsibility among their employees.Organizations should not shy away from embracing remote-work arrangements, as the study reveals that these can lead to better cybersecurity outcomes. By fostering a culture of trust, personal responsibility and cybersecurity awareness among remote employees, companies can empower their workforce to take the necessary precautions and maintain a high level of vigilance, ultimately leading to a more secure digital environment.SHARE:'},\n",

       "  'Content': 'CALGARY — Canada\\'s top technical authority on cybersecurity is working closely with Suncor Energy Inc. in the aftermath of a high-profile systems breach at the oil and gas giant.The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security — which leads Canada\\'s federal response to cybersecurity incidents — said Wednesday it can\\'t disclose details of the cybersecurity incident that caused payment systems at many of Suncor\\'s Petro-Canada locations across the country to go down last week.Sami Khoury, head of the centre, said Suncor is still working to mitigate the damage, and sharing information too soon may compromise those efforts.“We have reached out to Suncor and we are working with them, and we are sharing information with the rest of the (oil and gas) sector to better protect themselves,\" Khoury told reporters in a media briefing.\"But at this point the mitigation is still ongoing, and I am unable to provide additional details about the nature of the incident.”Suncor, one of Canada\\'s largest oil and gas firms, issued a news release a week and a half ago to say that it had \"experienced a cybersecurity incident.\\'\\'The confirmation followed days of public speculation and complaints on social media from customers unable to use credit or debit cards at the company\\'s chain of Petro-Canada gas stations in multiple major Canadian cities, or access car wash services.Suncor has not provided details about the type of cyberattack that occurred or whether any of its other operations were affected.

He said its message — that the oil and gas sector attracts \"more than its share\" of attention from cybercriminals — is important for the industry as a whole to hear.He added that in addition to the report, the Centre for Cyber Security also recently hosted a briefing for high-level senior executives within the energy industry.“By and large, companies are mindful of the cybersecurity threat and are putting investments in place to mitigate it, but it’s important to recognize that the threat is constantly evolving, and those investments need to keep up,\" Khoury said.“It’s not a one-time solution.”The Centre for Cyber Security says Canada\\'s oil and gas sector is an attractive target because of the high value of the industry\\'s assets and \"the degree of customer dependence on the industry\\'s products.\"Ransomware attacks, conducted by cybercriminals motivated purely by financial gain, are by far the likeliest type of cyber threat oil and gas companies face, Khoury said.

       "  'Content': 'Imagine a home filled with sophisticated locks, closed-circuit television cameras and a state-of-the-art security system. Yet the owner leaves the back door wide open.This is precisely what’s happening in the world of corporate cybersecurity. As organizations fret over the potential risks of remote work, new research suggests the real dangers lurk within the office itself, according to the findings of a groundbreaking study by the Farmer School of Business at Miami University (forthcoming in the July issue of the peer-reviewed journal Computers & Security).The researchers discovered that remote workers exhibit a higher level of cybersecurity awareness and take more security-related precautions than their in-office counterparts. That’s right, working from home apparently makes employees more vigilant when it comes to cybersecurity.“When we surveyed remote workers, we expected the results to reveal cybersecurity complacency. But surprisingly, the survey revealed remote cyber-vigilance,” the study’s author, Joseph K. Nwankpa, told me.This surprising outcome can be attributed to the so-called “Peltzman effect” and the complacency framework, which the study draws on to explore how remote work may trigger a moral hazard regarding employee cybersecurity awareness and security-based precaution-taking.Remote employees tend to feel a heightened sense of responsibility for their own cybersecurity, while office workers often become complacent, trusting their companies to handle cyberthreats on their behalf.Imagine being on a cruise ship with an impeccable safety record. You might feel so secure that you skip the safety drill and neglect to learn the location of the lifeboats. This is the complacency effect in action. Office workers, surrounded by the perceived safety of their company’s cybersecurity measures, may be less likely to follow best practices and take necessary precautions.The study cites prior research that reveals how employees working within the corporate office and boundaries trust their firms to develop, maintain and update security countermeasures to mitigate cybersecurity threats and risks. As a result, these employees are not apt or mindful of security threats and concerns, leading to constrained cybersecurity awareness.On the other hand, remote workers, like sailors navigating stormy seas, understand that they must be constantly vigilant. This heightened awareness leads them to take more security-based precautions, ultimately keeping their company’s digital assets safer.Indeed, the human element of security is enhanced through a switch to remote work.“Our study found that working from the office within corporate firewalls and security boundaries induced employees to exhibit risky cybersecurity behaviour, such as diminished cybersecurity awareness and precaution-taking,” Nwankpa said. But, “switching to remote work made employees feel insecure, leading to heightened cybersecurity awareness and cybersecurity precautionary measures.”The research model used in the study examined the impact of remote work on security-based precaution-taking and the role of cybersecurity awareness in the relationship between remote work and security-based precaution-taking. The data collected from 203 remote workers across the U.S. provided strong support for the research model, indicating that remote work is positively associated with cybersecurity awareness and security-based precaution-taking.Furthermore, the study revealed that as remote workers gain cybersecurity awareness, they are more likely to apply security-based precaution measures. This reinforces the idea that fostering cybersecurity awareness among remote workers can lead to better protection of organizational information assets against threats.Contrary to popular belief, the findings of this study demonstrate that remote work can actually improve cybersecurity. Companies can leverage this knowledge to their advantage, promoting remote-work arrangements and fostering a culture of vigilance and cybersecurity responsibility among their employees.Organizations should not shy away from embracing remote-work arrangements, as the study reveals that these can lead to better cybersecurity outcomes. By fostering a culture of trust, personal responsibility and cybersecurity awareness among remote employees, companies can empower their workforce to take the necessary precautions and maintain a high level of vigilance, ultimately leading to a more secure digital environment.SHARE:'},\n",

On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.What’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.Event Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register NowThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.The HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.Considered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.Lessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.Improving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023Turning weaknesses into strengths with zero trustForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.In fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.Forrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”Every healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threatsThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.The first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).Second, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.Proliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.To understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.Another brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”Two high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer serviceHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.DeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.IoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battleMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.Absolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.A core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.Protecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priorityHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.Telesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction. He told VentureBeat that customers could gain reassurance from friction that a brand, company or healthcare provider has an advanced understanding of cybersecurity and, most importantly, of the importance of protecting patient data and privacy.'}]"

       "  'Content': 'Join top executives in San Francisco on July 11-12 and learn how business leaders are getting ahead of the generative AI revolution. Learn MoreHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.Attackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.Healthcare must build on cloud security with zero trustForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.What’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.Event Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register NowThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.The HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.Considered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.Lessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.Improving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023Turning weaknesses into strengths with zero trustForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.In fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.Forrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”Every healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threatsThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.The first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).Second, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.Proliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.To understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.Another brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”Two high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer serviceHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.DeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.IoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battleMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.Absolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.A core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.Protecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priorityHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.Telesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction. He told VentureBeat that customers could gain reassurance from friction that a brand, company or healthcare provider has an advanced understanding of cybersecurity and, most importantly, of the importance of protecting patient data and privacy.'},\n",

       "  'Content': 'Imagine a home filled with sophisticated locks, closed-circuit television cameras and a state-of-the-art security system. Yet the owner leaves the back door wide open.This is precisely what’s happening in the world of corporate cybersecurity. As organizations fret over the potential risks of remote work, new research suggests the real dangers lurk within the office itself, according to the findings of a groundbreaking study by the Farmer School of Business at Miami University (forthcoming in the July issue of the peer-reviewed journal Computers & Security).The researchers discovered that remote workers exhibit a higher level of cybersecurity awareness and take more security-related precautions than their in-office counterparts. That’s right, working from home apparently makes employees more vigilant when it comes to cybersecurity.“When we surveyed remote workers, we expected the results to reveal cybersecurity complacency. But surprisingly, the survey revealed remote cyber-vigilance,” the study’s author, Joseph K. Nwankpa, told me.This surprising outcome can be attributed to the so-called “Peltzman effect” and the complacency framework, which the study draws on to explore how remote work may trigger a moral hazard regarding employee cybersecurity awareness and security-based precaution-taking.Remote employees tend to feel a heightened sense of responsibility for their own cybersecurity, while office workers often become complacent, trusting their companies to handle cyberthreats on their behalf.Imagine being on a cruise ship with an impeccable safety record. You might feel so secure that you skip the safety drill and neglect to learn the location of the lifeboats. This is the complacency effect in action. Office workers, surrounded by the perceived safety of their company’s cybersecurity measures, may be less likely to follow best practices and take necessary precautions.The study cites prior research that reveals how employees working within the corporate office and boundaries trust their firms to develop, maintain and update security countermeasures to mitigate cybersecurity threats and risks. As a result, these employees are not apt or mindful of security threats and concerns, leading to constrained cybersecurity awareness.On the other hand, remote workers, like sailors navigating stormy seas, understand that they must be constantly vigilant. This heightened awareness leads them to take more security-based precautions, ultimately keeping their company’s digital assets safer.Indeed, the human element of security is enhanced through a switch to remote work.“Our study found that working from the office within corporate firewalls and security boundaries induced employees to exhibit risky cybersecurity behaviour, such as diminished cybersecurity awareness and precaution-taking,” Nwankpa said. But, “switching to remote work made employees feel insecure, leading to heightened cybersecurity awareness and cybersecurity precautionary measures.”The research model used in the study examined the impact of remote work on security-based precaution-taking and the role of cybersecurity awareness in the relationship between remote work and security-based precaution-taking. The data collected from 203 remote workers across the U.S. provided strong support for the research model, indicating that remote work is positively associated with cybersecurity awareness and security-based precaution-taking.Furthermore, the study revealed that as remote workers gain cybersecurity awareness, they are more likely to apply security-based precaution measures. This reinforces the idea that fostering cybersecurity awareness among remote workers can lead to better protection of organizational information assets against threats.Contrary to popular belief, the findings of this study demonstrate that remote work can actually improve cybersecurity. Companies can leverage this knowledge to their advantage, promoting remote-work arrangements and fostering a culture of vigilance and cybersecurity responsibility among their employees.Organizations should not shy away from embracing remote-work arrangements, as the study reveals that these can lead to better cybersecurity outcomes. By fostering a culture of trust, personal responsibility and cybersecurity awareness among remote employees, companies can empower their workforce to take the necessary precautions and maintain a high level of vigilance, ultimately leading to a more secure digital environment.SHARE:'}]"

       "  'Content': 'Imaginez une maison remplie de serrures sophistiquées, de caméras de télévision en circuit fermé et d\\'un système de sécurité à la fine pointe de la technologie. Pourtant, le propriétaire laisse la porte dérobée grande ouverte. C\\'est précisément ce qui se passe dans le monde de la cybersécurité des entreprises. Alors que les organisations s\\'inquiètent des risques potentiels du travail à distance, de nouvelles recherches suggèrent que les véritables dangers se cachent au sein du bureau lui-même, selon les conclusions d\\'une étude révolutionnaire de la Farmer School of Business de l\\'Université de Miami (à paraître dans le numéro de juillet du peer- revue revue Computers & Security). Les chercheurs ont découvert que les travailleurs à distance présentent un niveau de sensibilisation à la cybersécurité plus élevé et prennent plus de précautions liées à la sécurité que leurs homologues au bureau. C\\'est vrai, le travail à domicile rend apparemment les employés plus vigilants en matière de cybersécurité. \"Lorsque nous avons interrogé les travailleurs à distance, nous nous attendions à ce que les résultats révèlent une complaisance en matière de cybersécurité. Mais étonnamment, l\\'enquête a révélé une cyber-vigilance à distance », l\\'auteur de l\\'étude, Joseph K. Nwankpa, m\\'a dit. Ce résultat surprenant peut être attribué à ce que l\\'on appelle «l\\'effet Peltzman» et au cadre de complaisance, sur lequel l\\'étude s\\'appuie pour explorer comment le travail à distance peut déclencher un aléa moral concernant la cybersécurité des employés. sensibilisation et prise de précautions basées sur la sécurité. Les employés distants ont tendance à se sentir davantage responsables de leur propre cybersécurité, tandis que les employés de bureau deviennent souvent complaisants, faisant confiance à leurs entreprises pour gérer les cybermenaces en leur nom. Imaginez être sur un bateau de croisière avec un fiche de sécurité. Vous pourriez vous sentir tellement en sécurité que vous sautez l\\'exercice de sécurité et que vous négligez de connaître l\\'emplacement des canots de sauvetage. C\\'est l\\'effet de complaisance en action. Les employés de bureau, entourés par la sécurité perçue des mesures de cybersécurité de leur entreprise, peuvent être moins susceptibles de suivre les meilleures pratiques et de prendre les précautions nécessaires. L\\'étude cite des recherches antérieures qui révèlent comment les employés travaillant au sein du siège social et d frontières font confiance à leurs entreprises pour développer, maintenir et mettre à jour des contre-mesures de sécurité afin d\\'atténuer les menaces et les risques de cybersécurité. En conséquence, ces employés ne sont pas aptes ou conscients des menaces et des préoccupations en matière de sécurité, ce qui entraîne une sensibilisation limitée à la cybersécurité. D\\'autre part, les travailleurs à distance, comme les marins naviguant sur des mers agitées, comprennent qu\\'ils doivent être constamment vigilants. Cette prise de conscience accrue les amène à prendre davantage de précautions basées sur la sécurité, ce qui, en fin de compte, assure la sécurité des actifs numériques de leur entreprise. En effet, l\\'élément humain de la sécurité est renforcé par le passage au travail à distance. les limites de sécurité ont incité les employés à adopter des comportements à risque en matière de cybersécurité, tels qu\\'une sensibilisation réduite à la cybersécurité et une prise de précautions », a déclaré Nwankpa. Mais, \"le passage au travail à distance a rendu les employés peu sûrs, ce qui a conduit à une sensibilisation accrue à la cybersécurité et à des mesures de précaution en matière de cybersécurité\". Le modèle rch utilisé dans l\\'étude a examiné l\\'impact du travail à distance sur la prise de précaution basée sur la sécurité et le rôle de la sensibilisation à la cybersécurité dans la relation entre le travail à distance et la prise de précaution basée sur la sécurité. Les données recueillies auprès de 203 travailleurs à distance à travers les États-Unis ont fortement soutenu le modèle de recherche, indiquant que le travail à distance est positivement associé à la sensibilisation à la cybersécurité et à la prise de précautions basées sur la sécurité. De plus, l\\'étude a révélé qu\\'à mesure que les travailleurs à distance gagnent en sensibilisation à la cybersécurité, ils sont plus susceptibles d\\'appliquer des mesures de précaution fondées sur la sécurité. Cela renforce l\\'idée que la sensibilisation à la cybersécurité chez les travailleurs à distance peut conduire à une meilleure protection des actifs informationnels de l\\'organisation contre les menaces. Contrairement à la croyance populaire, les résultats de cette étude démontrent que le travail à distance peut réellement améliorer la cybersécurité. Les entreprises peuvent tirer parti de ces connaissances à leur avantage, en promouvant les arrangements de travail à distance et en favorisant une culture o f vigilance et responsabilité en matière de cybersécurité parmi leurs employés. Les organisations ne doivent pas hésiter à adopter des accords de travail à distance, car l\\'étude révèle que ceux-ci peuvent conduire à de meilleurs résultats en matière de cybersécurité. En favorisant une culture de confiance, de responsabilité personnelle et de sensibilisation à la cybersécurité parmi les employés distants, les entreprises peuvent donner à leur personnel les moyens de prendre les précautions nécessaires et de maintenir un niveau élevé de vigilance, ce qui conduit finalement à un environnement numérique plus sécurisé.PARTAGE:'},\n",

Leurs efforts combinés pour prouver que les plates-formes cloud sont plus sécurisées que les serveurs de réseau hérités résonnent.Event Transform 2023 Rejoignez-nous à San Francisco le 11 juillet -12, où les cadres supérieurs partageront comment ils ont intégré et optimisé les investissements en IA pour réussir et éviter les pièges courants. C\\'est une excellente nouvelle pour l\\'industrie, car les dernières données du portail de violation du département américain de la santé et des services sociaux (HHS) montrent qu\\'au cours des 18 derniers mois seulement, 458 prestataires de soins de santé ont été piratés via des serveurs de réseau, exposant plus de 69 millions de patients identités. Le portail HHS montre que cette pandémie numérique a compromis 39,9 millions d\\'identités de patients au cours des six premiers mois de 2023, récoltées à partir de 298 violations. Parmi ceux-ci, 229 résultaient d\\'un piratage réussi, 61 d\\'un accès/divulgation non autorisé et le reste d\\'un vol de dossiers médicaux. La compromission des e-mails professionnels (BEC) et le faux-semblant sont responsables de 54 violations depuis janvier, compromettant l\\'identité de 838 241 patients. Considérés comme des best-sellers sur le Dark Web, les dossiers médicaux des patients fournissent une mine de données aux attaquants. Gangs cybercriminels et organisations mondiales des groupes de menaces persistantes avancées (APT) volent, vendent et utilisent des identités de patients pour créer des identités frauduleuses synthétiques. Les attaquants reçoivent jusqu\\'à 1 000 dollars par enregistrement en fonction du degré de détail de l\\'identité et des données médicales. Les leçons du Telesign Trust Index 2023, qui a montré la fragilité croissante de la confiance numérique, doivent également être appliquées aux soins de santé. plates-formes de cloud public, tempérées par les problèmes de confidentialité. Le secteur de la santé doit viser plus haut et s\\'attaquer aux vecteurs de menace à haut risque, en commençant par les terminaux et une meilleure gestion des identités, des accès et des accès privilégiés. Source : Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023Transformer les faiblesses en atouts sans aucune confianceForrester conclut que les prestataires de soins de santé sont des cibles de choix pour les pirates, car ils utilisent des technologies héritées obsolètes, en particulier lors du stockage de données sensibles sur les patients. Cette faiblesse est amplifiée par l\\'urgence d\\'obtenir des soins intensifs pour le patient ts. «Les acteurs de la menace ciblent de plus en plus les failles de la cyber-hygiène, y compris les processus de gestion des vulnérabilités hérités», a déclaré Srinivas Mukkamala, directeur produit chez Ivanti, à VentureBeat. En fait, Ivanti\\'s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report a révélé que toutes les en retard dans la protection contre les ransomwares, les vulnérabilités logicielles, les attaques liées aux API et les attaques de la chaîne d\\'approvisionnement logicielle. Les résultats de la recherche d\\'Ivanti soulignent pourquoi la confiance zéro doit devenir une priorité urgente dans toutes les organisations de soins de santé, étant donné que beaucoup sont à la traîne par rapport à leurs pairs dans d\\'autres secteurs sur ces dimensions fondamentales. La plate-forme mutualisée peut bénéficier aux prestataires de soins de santé avec un cryptage de données AES 256 de niveau militaire qui aide à prévenir l\\'exposition et le vol de données. Les hyperscalers mondiaux proposent des instances conformes et des services de conseil pour aider à respecter la conformité réglementaire. De même, les systèmes EHR tels qu\\'Oracle Cerner et Epic Systems proposent désormais des offres/partenariats basés sur le cloud. \"Chaque fournisseur de soins de santé a besoin d\\'une feuille de route de confiance zéro adaptée à ses plus grandes menaces. L\\'objectif est de devenir plus résilient au fil du temps sans casser les budgets ou demander des investissements majeurs au conseil d\\'administration. Un excellent point de départ est une feuille de route zéro confiance. Il existe quelques documents standard que les RSSI et les DSI qui gèrent l\\'informatique de santé et la cybersécurité devraient utiliser pour adapter la sécurité zéro confiance à leurs défis commerciaux uniques. Le premier provient du National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) du National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). . Le livre blanc du NIST sur la cybersécurité (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, décrit les processus de migration vers une architecture de confiance zéro à l\\'aide du NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). Deuxièmement, John Kindervag, qui a créé zéro confiance chez Forrester et occupe actuellement le poste de vice-président senior, stratégie de cybersécurité et Le membre du groupe ON2IT chez ON2IT Cybersecurity et le Dr Chase Cunningham faisaient partie de plusieurs leaders de l\\'industrie qui ont rédigé le projet utile du Comité consultatif sur la sécurité nationale des télécommunications du président (NSTAC) sur la confiance zéro et la gestion de l\\'identité de confiance. Le document définit l\\'architecture de confiance zéro comme \"une architecture qui traite tous les utilisateurs comme des menaces potentielles et empêche l\\'accès aux données et aux ressources jusqu\\'à ce que les utilisateurs puissent être correctement authentifiés et leur accès autorisé\". La Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publie un hub des publications du président du NSTAC, fournissant un index précieux de l\\'ensemble des travaux du comité. La prolifération des attaques de rançongiciels souligne la nécessité d\\'appliquer l\\'accès le moins privilégié sur toutes les surfaces de menace. ], la première machine [violée] peut se déplacer latéralement vers la machine suivante, puis la machine suivante, et la machine suivante. Donc, une fois qu\\'ils ont compris cela, le ch Les risques que vous ayez une violation de ransomware et que des données soient exfiltrées de votre environnement augmentent », a déclaré Drex DeFord, stratège exécutif et directeur des systèmes d\\'information des soins de santé chez CrowdStrike, à VentureBeat lors d\\'une interview. (HC3) fournit une série de notes d\\'information sur les menaces auxquelles les RSSI et les DSI du secteur de la santé devraient envisager de s\\'abonner et de se tenir au courant. La profondeur de l\\'analyse et de la perspicacité que le HCS met dans ces mémoires est remarquable. les attaques contre les États-nations sont parmi les plus sophistiquées et les plus difficiles à arrêter: le Threat Brief du 3novembre2022 intitulé \"Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare\". Service de retenue nseLes prestataires de soins de santé et les organisations de soutien ont besoin d\\'une base de référence claire sur tous les systèmes pour vérifier que leurs environnements informatiques et leurs piles technologiques existants sont propres. \"Lorsque vous avez fait une évaluation de compromis, [obtenir] un aperçu complet de l\\'ensemble de l\\'environnement et [s\\'assurer] que vous n\\'êtes pas propriétaire, et que vous ne le savez pas encore, est extrêmement important\", a déclaré DeFord à VentureBeat pendant une interview. DeFord et d\\'autres RSSI interrogés pour cet article conseillent également aux RSSI du secteur de la santé d\\'obtenir un service de retenue en cas d\\'incident s\\'ils n\\'en ont pas déjà un. \"Cela garantit que si quelque chose devait arriver, et que vous avez un incident de sécurité, vous pouvez appeler quelqu\\'un, et il viendra immédiatement\", conseille DeFord. L\\'IoT, l\\'informatique de pointe et les dispositifs médicaux connectés font de la sécurité des terminaux une bataille constante. les machines qui y sont attachées et les dispositifs médicaux ne sont pas conçus avec la sécurité comme objectif principal. C\\'est pourquoi les attaquants adorent ces appareils. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, directeur produit de la société de cybersécurité Ivanti, explique que les chefs d\\'entreprise doivent réaliser le coût de la gestion des terminaux, de l\\'IoT et des dispositifs médicaux en améliorant continuellement la sécurité. \"Les organisations doivent continuer à évoluer vers un modèle de gestion des terminaux sans confiance pour voir dans les coins et renforcer leur posture de sécurité\", a déclaré Mukkamala à VentureBeat. L\\'indice de résilience 2023 d\\'Absolute Software montre que le terminal moyen a 11 agents de sécurité différents installés, chacun se dégradant à vitesse différente et créant des conflits de mémoire. Cela laisse le terminal sans protection et vulnérable à une violation. Surcharger les points de terminaison avec trop d\\'agents est tout aussi grave que de n\\'en avoir aucun installé. Les RSSI et les DSI du secteur de la santé doivent auditer chaque agent de point de terminaison installé et découvrir s\\'ils sont en conflit les uns avec les autres et de quelle manière. Une partie essentielle de l\\'audit consiste à savoir quelles identités ont des droits d\\'accès pour chaque point de terminaison, y compris les sous-traitants et fournisseurs tiers. Les données d\\'audit capturées sont inv aluable dans la définition de politiques d\\'accès les moins privilégiés qui renforcent la confiance zéro sur chaque terminal. La protection de l\\'identité des patients nécessite de faire de la confiance zéro une priorité. L\\'un des atouts les plus précieux de tout fournisseur de soins de santé est la confiance des patients. De plus en plus de prestataires de soins de santé doivent réfléchir à la manière de créer des expériences client sécurisées avec une confiance zéro. C\\'est un excellent conseil pour les prestataires de soins de santé assiégés par les attaquants aujourd\\'hui. \"Les clients ne craignent pas les frictions s\\'ils comprennent qu\\'elles sont là pour assurer leur sécurité\", a déclaré Burton, ajoutant que l\\'apprentissage automatique est une technologie efficace pour rationaliser l\\'expérience utilisateur tout en équilibrant les frictions. . Il a dit à VentureBeat que cust omers pourrait être rassuré par les frictions sur le fait qu\\'une marque, une entreprise ou un fournisseur de soins de santé a une compréhension avancée de la cybersécurité et, surtout, de l\\'importance de protéger les données et la vie privée des patients.'},\n",

La confirmation fait suite à des jours de spéculation publique et de plaintes sur les réseaux sociaux de la part de clients incapables d\\'utiliser des cartes de crédit ou de débit dans la chaîne de l\\'entreprise. des stations-service Petro-Canada dans plusieurs grandes villes canadiennes, ou accéder à des services de lavage de voiture. Les systèmes de paiement du Canada avaient été en grande partie rétablis. Le Centre canadien pour la cybersécurité fait partie du Centre fédéral de la sécurité des télécommunications, qui fournit au gouvernement du Canada la sécurité des technologies de l\\'information et le renseignement électromagnétique étranger. Il avertit depuis des années que le secteur de l\\'énergie du Canada est un cible attrayante pour les cybercriminels. En fait, quelques jours seulement avant que la faille de sécurité de Suncor ne soit rendue publique, le centre a publié un rapport sur la cybermenace à laquelle est confrontée l\\'industrie pétrolière et gazière du pays. Il a déclaré que son message - que le secteur pétrolier et gazier attire \"plus que sa part\" d\\'attention de la part des cybercriminels - est important pour l\\'industrie dans son ensemble. Il a ajouté qu\\'en plus du rapport, le Center for Cyber \\u200b\\u200bSecurity a également récemment a organisé une séance d\\'information pour les cadres supérieurs de haut niveau de l\\'industrie de l\\'énergie. « Dans l\\'ensemble, les entreprises sont conscientes de la menace de la cybersécurité et mettent en place des investissements pour l\\'atténuer, mais il est important de reconnaître que la menace évolue constamment et que les investissements doivent suivre », a déclaré Khoury.« Il ne s\\'agit pas d\\'une solution ponctuelle. dépendance au produit de l\\'industrie s. \"Les attaques de ransomwares, menées par des cybercriminels motivés uniquement par le gain financier, sont de loin le type de cybermenace le plus probable auquel les sociétés pétrolières et gazières sont confrontées, a déclaré Khoury. Ces dernières années, les attaques de ransomwares ont considérablement augmenté en volume et en sophistication. En 2021 , une attaque de ransomware a ciblé avec succès le Colonial Pipeline, le plus grand réseau de pipelines de produits pétroliers raffinés aux États-Unis. Il s\\'agissait de la plus grande cyberattaque contre les infrastructures pétrolières de l\\'histoire des États-Unis et a forcé l\\'entreprise à interrompre temporairement les opérations de pipeline.Parrainé par l\\'État ou les cybercriminels alignés sur l\\'État - y compris ceux qui ont des liens avec la Russie, la Chine, la Corée du Nord et l\\'Iran - présentent également un risque pour le secteur, a déclaré Khoury.Une cyberattaque de ce type serait probablement à des fins de sabotage industriel ou d\\'espionnage. une cyberattaque parrainée par l\\'État visant à perturber le flux de pétrole et de gaz dans ce pays est hautement improbable, sauf dans le cas d\\'hostilités pures et simples entre le Canada et et un autre pays. «Mais la menace est réelle, et les fournisseurs d\\'infrastructures essentielles doivent s\\'y préparer», a-t-il déclaré. proportion de tout secteur d\\'infrastructure critique.Certains experts ont déclaré que la violation des systèmes de Suncor coûtera probablement des millions de dollars à l\\'entreprise avant qu\\'elle ne soit résolue.Selon un rapport d\\'IBM, le coût moyen mondial pour les entreprises d\\'une violation de données a atteint un niveau record élevé en 2022 de 4,35 millions de dollars américains, une augmentation de 13 % par rapport à 2020. Aux États-Unis, le coût moyen pour les entreprises d\\'une violation de données en 2022 était de 9,44 millions de dollars américains.

       "  'Content': 'Imaginez une maison remplie de serrures sophistiquées, de caméras de télévision en circuit fermé et d\\'un système de sécurité à la fine pointe de la technologie. Pourtant, le propriétaire laisse la porte dérobée grande ouverte. C\\'est précisément ce qui se passe dans le monde de la cybersécurité des entreprises. Alors que les organisations s\\'inquiètent des risques potentiels du travail à distance, de nouvelles recherches suggèrent que les véritables dangers se cachent au sein du bureau lui-même, selon les conclusions d\\'une étude révolutionnaire de la Farmer School of Business de l\\'Université de Miami (à paraître dans le numéro de juillet du peer- revue revue Computers & Security). Les chercheurs ont découvert que les travailleurs à distance présentent un niveau de sensibilisation à la cybersécurité plus élevé et prennent plus de précautions liées à la sécurité que leurs homologues au bureau. C\\'est vrai, le travail à domicile rend apparemment les employés plus vigilants en matière de cybersécurité. \"Lorsque nous avons interrogé les travailleurs à distance, nous nous attendions à ce que les résultats révèlent une complaisance en matière de cybersécurité. Mais étonnamment, l\\'enquête a révélé une cyber-vigilance à distance », l\\'auteur de l\\'étude, Joseph K. Nwankpa, m\\'a dit. Ce résultat surprenant peut être attribué à ce que l\\'on appelle «l\\'effet Peltzman» et au cadre de complaisance, sur lequel l\\'étude s\\'appuie pour explorer comment le travail à distance peut déclencher un aléa moral concernant la cybersécurité des employés. sensibilisation et prise de précautions basées sur la sécurité. Les employés distants ont tendance à se sentir davantage responsables de leur propre cybersécurité, tandis que les employés de bureau deviennent souvent complaisants, faisant confiance à leurs entreprises pour gérer les cybermenaces en leur nom. Imaginez être sur un bateau de croisière avec un fiche de sécurité. Vous pourriez vous sentir tellement en sécurité que vous sautez l\\'exercice de sécurité et que vous négligez de connaître l\\'emplacement des canots de sauvetage. C\\'est l\\'effet de complaisance en action. Les employés de bureau, entourés par la sécurité perçue des mesures de cybersécurité de leur entreprise, peuvent être moins susceptibles de suivre les meilleures pratiques et de prendre les précautions nécessaires. L\\'étude cite des recherches antérieures qui révèlent comment les employés travaillant au sein du siège social et d frontières font confiance à leurs entreprises pour développer, maintenir et mettre à jour des contre-mesures de sécurité afin d\\'atténuer les menaces et les risques de cybersécurité. En conséquence, ces employés ne sont pas aptes ou conscients des menaces et des préoccupations en matière de sécurité, ce qui entraîne une sensibilisation limitée à la cybersécurité. D\\'autre part, les travailleurs à distance, comme les marins naviguant sur des mers agitées, comprennent qu\\'ils doivent être constamment vigilants. Cette prise de conscience accrue les amène à prendre davantage de précautions basées sur la sécurité, ce qui, en fin de compte, assure la sécurité des actifs numériques de leur entreprise. En effet, l\\'élément humain de la sécurité est renforcé par le passage au travail à distance. les limites de sécurité ont incité les employés à adopter des comportements à risque en matière de cybersécurité, tels qu\\'une sensibilisation réduite à la cybersécurité et une prise de précautions », a déclaré Nwankpa. Mais, \"le passage au travail à distance a rendu les employés peu sûrs, ce qui a conduit à une sensibilisation accrue à la cybersécurité et à des mesures de précaution en matière de cybersécurité\". Le modèle rch utilisé dans l\\'étude a examiné l\\'impact du travail à distance sur la prise de précaution basée sur la sécurité et le rôle de la sensibilisation à la cybersécurité dans la relation entre le travail à distance et la prise de précaution basée sur la sécurité. Les données recueillies auprès de 203 travailleurs à distance à travers les États-Unis ont fortement soutenu le modèle de recherche, indiquant que le travail à distance est positivement associé à la sensibilisation à la cybersécurité et à la prise de précautions basées sur la sécurité. De plus, l\\'étude a révélé qu\\'à mesure que les travailleurs à distance gagnent en sensibilisation à la cybersécurité, ils sont plus susceptibles d\\'appliquer des mesures de précaution fondées sur la sécurité. Cela renforce l\\'idée que la sensibilisation à la cybersécurité chez les travailleurs à distance peut conduire à une meilleure protection des actifs informationnels de l\\'organisation contre les menaces. Contrairement à la croyance populaire, les résultats de cette étude démontrent que le travail à distance peut réellement améliorer la cybersécurité. Les entreprises peuvent tirer parti de ces connaissances à leur avantage, en promouvant les arrangements de travail à distance et en favorisant une culture o f vigilance et responsabilité en matière de cybersécurité parmi leurs employés. Les organisations ne doivent pas hésiter à adopter des accords de travail à distance, car l\\'étude révèle que ceux-ci peuvent conduire à de meilleurs résultats en matière de cybersécurité. En favorisant une culture de confiance, de responsabilité personnelle et de sensibilisation à la cybersécurité parmi les employés distants, les entreprises peuvent donner à leur personnel les moyens de prendre les précautions nécessaires et de maintenir un niveau élevé de vigilance, ce qui conduit finalement à un environnement numérique plus sécurisé.PARTAGE:',\n",

Le vol de dossiers médicaux, d\\'identités et d\\'informations d\\'identification d\\'accès privilégié est une priorité absolue pour les cyberattaquants du secteur de la santé. En moyenne, il faut 10,1 millions de dollars à un fournisseur de soins de santé pour se remettre d\\'une attaque. Un quart des prestataires de soins de santé déclarent qu\\'une attaque de ransomware les a forcés à arrêter complètement leurs opérations.Les soins de santé doivent s\\'appuyer sur la sécurité du cloud sans confianceLe récent rapport de Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, donne un aperçu perspicace de la façon ast-suivi de leur adoption du cloud dans l\\'espoir de maîtriser la cybersécurité. Quatre-vingt-huit pour cent des décideurs mondiaux du secteur de la santé ont adopté des plates-formes de cloud public et 59% adoptent Kubernetes pour assurer une plus grande disponibilité de leurs systèmes d\\'entreprise de base. En moyenne, les prestataires de soins de santé dépensent 9,5 millions de dollars par an sur toutes les plateformes de cloud public qu\\'ils ont intégrées à leurs piles technologiques. Cela s\\'avère efficace - jusqu\\'à un certain point. Ce qu\\'il faut, c\\'est que les prestataires de soins de santé redoublent d\\'efforts sur la confiance zéro, en se concentrant d\\'abord sur la gestion de l\\'accès à l\\'identité (IAM) et la sécurité des terminaux. La partie la plus perspicace du rapport Forrester est la preuve qu\\'il fournit que les développements continus d\\'Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure et IBM Cloud font mouche auprès des prestataires de soins de santé. Leurs efforts combinés pour prouver que les plates-formes cloud sont plus sécurisées que les serveurs de réseau hérités résonnent.Event Transform 2023 Rejoignez-nous à San Francisco le 11 juillet -12, où les cadres supérieurs partageront comment ils ont intégré et optimisé les investissements en IA pour réussir et éviter les pièges courants. C\\'est une excellente nouvelle pour l\\'industrie, car les dernières données du portail de violation du département américain de la santé et des services sociaux (HHS) montrent qu\\'au cours des 18 derniers mois seulement, 458 prestataires de soins de santé ont été piratés via des serveurs de réseau, exposant plus de 69 millions de patients identités. Le portail HHS montre que cette pandémie numérique a compromis 39,9 millions d\\'identités de patients au cours des six premiers mois de 2023, récoltées à partir de 298 violations. Parmi ceux-ci, 229 résultaient d\\'un piratage réussi, 61 d\\'un accès/divulgation non autorisé et le reste d\\'un vol de dossiers médicaux. La compromission des e-mails professionnels (BEC) et le faux-semblant sont responsables de 54 violations depuis janvier, compromettant l\\'identité de 838 241 patients. Considérés comme des best-sellers sur le Dark Web, les dossiers médicaux des patients fournissent une mine de données aux attaquants. Gangs cybercriminels et organisations mondiales des groupes de menaces persistantes avancées (APT) volent, vendent et utilisent des identités de patients pour créer des identités frauduleuses synthétiques. Les attaquants reçoivent jusqu\\'à 1 000 dollars par enregistrement en fonction du degré de détail de l\\'identité et des données médicales. Les leçons du Telesign Trust Index 2023, qui a montré la fragilité croissante de la confiance numérique, doivent également être appliquées aux soins de santé. plates-formes de cloud public, tempérées par les problèmes de confidentialité. Le secteur de la santé doit viser plus haut et s\\'attaquer aux vecteurs de menace à haut risque, en commençant par les terminaux et une meilleure gestion des identités, des accès et des accès privilégiés. Source : Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023Transformer les faiblesses en atouts sans aucune confianceForrester conclut que les prestataires de soins de santé sont des cibles de choix pour les pirates, car ils utilisent des technologies héritées obsolètes, en particulier lors du stockage de données sensibles sur les patients. Cette faiblesse est amplifiée par l\\'urgence d\\'obtenir des soins intensifs pour le patient ts. «Les acteurs de la menace ciblent de plus en plus les failles de la cyber-hygiène, y compris les processus de gestion des vulnérabilités hérités», a déclaré Srinivas Mukkamala, directeur produit chez Ivanti, à VentureBeat. En fait, Ivanti\\'s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report a révélé que toutes les en retard dans la protection contre les ransomwares, les vulnérabilités logicielles, les attaques liées aux API et les attaques de la chaîne d\\'approvisionnement logicielle. Les résultats de la recherche d\\'Ivanti soulignent pourquoi la confiance zéro doit devenir une priorité urgente dans toutes les organisations de soins de santé, étant donné que beaucoup sont à la traîne par rapport à leurs pairs dans d\\'autres secteurs sur ces dimensions fondamentales. La plate-forme mutualisée peut bénéficier aux prestataires de soins de santé avec un cryptage de données AES 256 de niveau militaire qui aide à prévenir l\\'exposition et le vol de données. Les hyperscalers mondiaux proposent des instances conformes et des services de conseil pour aider à respecter la conformité réglementaire. De même, les systèmes EHR tels qu\\'Oracle Cerner et Epic Systems proposent désormais des offres/partenariats basés sur le cloud. \"Chaque fournisseur de soins de santé a besoin d\\'une feuille de route de confiance zéro adaptée à ses plus grandes menaces. L\\'objectif est de devenir plus résilient au fil du temps sans casser les budgets ou demander des investissements majeurs au conseil d\\'administration. Un excellent point de départ est une feuille de route zéro confiance. Il existe quelques documents standard que les RSSI et les DSI qui gèrent l\\'informatique de santé et la cybersécurité devraient utiliser pour adapter la sécurité zéro confiance à leurs défis commerciaux uniques. Le premier provient du National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) du National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). . Le livre blanc du NIST sur la cybersécurité (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, décrit les processus de migration vers une architecture de confiance zéro à l\\'aide du NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). Deuxièmement, John Kindervag, qui a créé zéro confiance chez Forrester et occupe actuellement le poste de vice-président senior, stratégie de cybersécurité et Le membre du groupe ON2IT chez ON2IT Cybersecurity et le Dr Chase Cunningham faisaient partie de plusieurs leaders de l\\'industrie qui ont rédigé le projet utile du Comité consultatif sur la sécurité nationale des télécommunications du président (NSTAC) sur la confiance zéro et la gestion de l\\'identité de confiance. Le document définit l\\'architecture de confiance zéro comme \"une architecture qui traite tous les utilisateurs comme des menaces potentielles et empêche l\\'accès aux données et aux ressources jusqu\\'à ce que les utilisateurs puissent être correctement authentifiés et leur accès autorisé\". La Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publie un hub des publications du président du NSTAC, fournissant un index précieux de l\\'ensemble des travaux du comité.

(HC3) fournit une série de notes d\\'information sur les menaces auxquelles les RSSI et les DSI du secteur de la santé devraient envisager de s\\'abonner et de se tenir au courant. La profondeur de l\\'analyse et de la perspicacité que le HCS met dans ces mémoires est remarquable. les attaques contre les États-nations sont parmi les plus sophistiquées et les plus difficiles à arrêter: le Threat Brief du 3novembre2022 intitulé \"Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare\". Service de retenue nseLes prestataires de soins de santé et les organisations de soutien ont besoin d\\'une base de référence claire sur tous les systèmes pour vérifier que leurs environnements informatiques et leurs piles technologiques existants sont propres. \"Lorsque vous avez fait une évaluation de compromis, [obtenir] un aperçu complet de l\\'ensemble de l\\'environnement et [s\\'assurer] que vous n\\'êtes pas propriétaire, et que vous ne le savez pas encore, est extrêmement important\", a déclaré DeFord à VentureBeat pendant une interview. DeFord et d\\'autres RSSI interrogés pour cet article conseillent également aux RSSI du secteur de la santé d\\'obtenir un service de retenue en cas d\\'incident s\\'ils n\\'en ont pas déjà un. \"Cela garantit que si quelque chose devait arriver, et que vous avez un incident de sécurité, vous pouvez appeler quelqu\\'un, et il viendra immédiatement\", conseille DeFord. L\\'IoT, l\\'informatique de pointe et les dispositifs médicaux connectés font de la sécurité des terminaux une bataille constante. les machines qui y sont attachées et les dispositifs médicaux ne sont pas conçus avec la sécurité comme objectif principal. C\\'est pourquoi les attaquants adorent ces appareils. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, directeur produit de la société de cybersécurité Ivanti, explique que les chefs d\\'entreprise doivent réaliser le coût de la gestion des terminaux, de l\\'IoT et des dispositifs médicaux en améliorant continuellement la sécurité. \"Les organisations doivent continuer à évoluer vers un modèle de gestion des terminaux sans confiance pour voir dans les coins et renforcer leur posture de sécurité\", a déclaré Mukkamala à VentureBeat. L\\'indice de résilience 2023 d\\'Absolute Software montre que le terminal moyen a 11 agents de sécurité différents installés, chacun se dégradant à vitesse différente et créant des conflits de mémoire. Cela laisse le terminal sans protection et vulnérable à une violation. Surcharger les points de terminaison avec trop d\\'agents est tout aussi grave que de n\\'en avoir aucun installé. Les RSSI et les DSI du secteur de la santé doivent auditer chaque agent de point de terminaison installé et découvrir s\\'ils sont en conflit les uns avec les autres et de quelle manière. Une partie essentielle de l\\'audit consiste à savoir quelles identités ont des droits d\\'accès pour chaque point de terminaison, y compris les sous-traitants et fournisseurs tiers. Les données d\\'audit capturées sont inv aluable dans la définition de politiques d\\'accès les moins privilégiés qui renforcent la confiance zéro sur chaque terminal. La protection de l\\'identité des patients nécessite de faire de la confiance zéro une priorité. L\\'un des atouts les plus précieux de tout fournisseur de soins de santé est la confiance des patients. De plus en plus de prestataires de soins de santé doivent réfléchir à la manière de créer des expériences client sécurisées avec une confiance zéro. C\\'est un excellent conseil pour les prestataires de soins de santé assiégés par les attaquants aujourd\\'hui. \"Les clients ne craignent pas les frictions s\\'ils comprennent qu\\'elles sont là pour assurer leur sécurité\", a déclaré Burton, ajoutant que l\\'apprentissage automatique est une technologie efficace pour rationaliser l\\'expérience utilisateur tout en équilibrant les frictions. . Il a dit à VentureBeat que cust omers pourrait être rassuré par les frictions sur le fait qu\\'une marque, une entreprise ou un fournisseur de soins de santé a une compréhension avancée de la cybersécurité et, surtout, de l\\'importance de protéger les données et la vie privée des patients.',\n",

Symantec, by Broadcom Software, is tracking the activity under its insect-themed moniker Lancefly , with the attacks making use of a \"powerful\" backdoor called Merdoor. Evidence gathered so far points to the custom implant being utilized as far back as 2018. The ultimate goal of the campaign, based on the tools and the victimology pattern, is assessed to be intelligence gathering. \"The backdoor is used very selectively, appearing on just a handful of networks and a small number of machines over the years, with its use appearing to be highly targeted,\" Symantec said in an analysis shared with The Hacker News. \"The attackers in this campaign also have access to an updated version of the ZXShell rootkit.\"',\n",

      "To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Matt Burgess In the summer of 2016, WhatsApp made an unprecedented change. The Meta-owned company turned on end-to-end encryption by default for all of the billion-plus people using it—becoming, in the process, the world's largest encrypted messenger. Since then, that number has topped 2 billion. Being end-to-end encrypted by default means nobody at Meta can read, or mine data from, the content of the messages you send. All texts, photos, videos, voice messages, documents, status updates, and calls are encrypted on WhatsApp, and only the people you send them to can access them. Devices decoding encrypted content must verify and exchange security codes as messages are transferred. The encryption that WhatsApp uses was originally developed by Open Whisper Systems, the group behind the encrypted messaging app rival Signal. In recent years, WhatsApp has introduced additional privacy and security features you can turn on. But even though WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption does protect your communications, that doesn’t mean the service is as private as it could be by default. In fact, when it comes to WhatsApp versus Signal, we recommend the latter for people wanting the maximum security and privacy options. However, with more than a third of the world using WhatsApp, its popularity is unrivaled, and you may not be able to drag all of your friends, family, and groups across to Signal. If that milestone is still some way off, here are some tips to make WhatsApp as private as possible. Updated May 2023: WhatsApp has introduced new privacy features since this story was first published in 2020. These changes are reflected below. WhatsApp can collect a lot more information about you than you might think. Much of what it collects is similar to many other apps and can be found in its privacy policies. There are separate privacy policies for the US, Europe, and the UK. There are some differences in what WhatsApp collects, based on Europe’s privacy rules. But the app is also part of Meta’s machine, which also includes Facebook and Instagram, and some information is shared with the parent company. The association alone can put people off using WhatsApp. The data WhatsApp has about you can come from multiple different sources: the information you provide (such as your phone number to sign up, or your location when you give it permission to share it with a friend), information that is collected automatically (for instance, when you’re online, or when you made a phone call), and information that others share about you (if a friend uploads your phone number, for example). Automatically collected, WhatsApp says, is information about how you use its services, how often and for how long you are on WhatsApp, and the features you use—including “group name, group picture, group description,” your profile photo, “about information,” and when you were last online. (Some of this information is used for safety features.) On top of that, WhatsApp may also collect information about your phone’s battery level, signal strength, and mobile operator. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian In the US, WhatsApp shares your phone number, phone information, IP address, and more with Meta’s other companies, although it says it does not “keep logs of who everyone’s messaging or calling” and doesn’t share contacts with Meta. In Europe, WhatsApp details how it works with Meta’s other companies and the information that is shared more explicitly. However, it’s worth stressing that the content of the messages you send isn’t shared, as Meta doesn’t have access to them due to WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption. Location information, when you turn it on, is also collected, and there are cookies that track your activity within the desktop and web versions of the app. WhatsApp allows you to back up your chats and data as a way to move all your information to a new phone. These backups work by storing your data in Google Drive or Apple’s iCloud, depending on which operating system you use. Backups can be handy if you’re moving to a new phone or lose your old device. If you’re going to use WhatsApp’s backups, you should use the version that is end-to-end encrypted. The company introduced these in 2021 after years of the option being unavailable. In WhatsApp, go to Settings, Chats, Chat Backup, and then once you have turned backups on, tap on End-to-end Encrypted Backup and toggle the option on. This backup requires a separate password, which you should ideally create and store in a password manager. If you lose this password, you won’t be able to get into your encrypted backup. You should be using two-factor authentication as much as possible—it’s even more important on accounts that hold your sensitive personal information, such as photos and messages. The security method involves adding an extra step to the process when you log in to an account. In most cases, this involves using a security code generated by an app, a code sent via SMS, or a physical security key. (The last of these is the most secure way to protect your accounts with two-factor authentication—and SMS is arguably the least secure of the three options.) Using WhatsApp is different from logging in to your email. It’s likely that you’ll access the app multiple times a day—on average, I open the app between 50 and 80 times per day. Entering a security code every time this happens would be impractical and frustrating. So instead, WhatsApp’s two-factor authentication, which can be turned on through the Settings menu and then by tapping on Account, uses a PIN. WhatsApp will semi-regularly ask you to reenter the six-digit PIN you create to access the app. It doesn’t say how often these prompts happen, but they’re irregular enough not to be a barrier to using the app. The PIN will also be required anytime there is an attempt to add your number to a new phone or device. When you’re setting the PIN, there’s also the option to add an email address that can be used to reset the code if you forget it. Your messages don’t have to live forever. It’s possible to turn on disappearing messages for when you want additional privacy or just don’t need to keep what you’re sent for years. There are two ways within WhatsApp to use self-destructing messages: for every new chat you have, or on an individual conversation basis. To run on disappearing messages by default for new conversations, go to Settings, Privacy, Default Message Timer, and pick how long you want messages to last for. There are three options if you turn the setting on: 24 hours, 7 days, or 90 days. For an existing individual conversation or group chat, open that chat, tap the person’s name at the top of the screen, select Disappearing Messages, and then pick 24 hours, 7 days, 90 days, or Off. You may then have to tap to confirm this. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian While turning on disappearing messages will give you some more privacy, it’s worth remembering that whoever you message could still screenshot or take a photograph of what’s on the screen. In addition to disappearing messages, you can also set photos and views to View Once. This—rather unsurprisingly—behaves exactly how it is described: The message can only opened one time and you can't go back to it once it's closed. When sending a photo or video, tap the icon that is contained within a partial circle. If you send a one-time image or video, people cannot screenshot it. There are inevitably times when you need to hand your phone to someone else—so your children can play games, for instance, or to show a friend a photo. WhatsApp has two features that can help protect your message if your phone falls into someone else’s hands. First, you can turn on Screen Lock, which keeps the app locked unless you open it with Apple’s Face ID or other biometrics on Android devices. To turn it on, go to Settings, Privacy, and select Screen Lock. You’ll need to set up the biometric options before you turn the app lock on. You can also lock down individual chats on your phone. This means that to send messages to locked chats, you’ll need to use your phone’s passcode, or your face or fingerprint to open up the chats and even see notifications from them. To turn it on, tap on a chat and the person’s name, go to Chat lock, and select the option to lock the chat. This will move the chat into a new folder that can be accessed by swiping down on the Chats tab. If you’re going for the most private approach, it’s also worth considering that any message that pops up could reveal private information. New message notifications can include the entire message or just some of its content when they flash up on your screen. If these notifications also sit unread, anyone picking up your device may be able to read them without having to unlock the phone. These options can be tweaked in Settings, Notifications, and Show Preview. While WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption stops law enforcement, internet providers, and even Meta from seeing what you are sending, there are still some additional steps you can take to increase your privacy on your phone and reduce the chances of your number being targeted by spammers or scammers. Because WhatsApp is so popular, it’s regularly the target of social engineering attacks, devised to steal your personal information. The ways to limit the ways people can interact with your account are all found through Settings, followed by tapping on Privacy. At the most simple, you can tap to turn off read receipts, the two blue ticks that show when someone has seen your message. More effective are the steps that stop people from adding you to groups. Under the Groups setting, there is the option to limit who can add you to a group. By default, this is set as “everyone.” However, it can be changed to My Contacts, or My Contacts Except…, allowing some exceptions. Deciding to limit who can add you to groups doesn’t mean that you can’t join groups when people aren’t in your contacts. Instead, people wanting to add you to groups can request to do so via a separate message. Within Privacy, you can also turn off who can see when you last looked at WhatsApp and when you were last online, who can see your profile photo, the About section, and WhatsApp Status. While in the privacy settings, you should also check whether you are sharing your live location with anyone. If you’re looking for more privacy, switching messaging apps is a big upheaval but could be worth the time and effort. As mentioned earlier, our preference for combining end-to-end encryption with greater levels of privacy is Signal.

Kate O'Flaherty Summer software updates are coming thick and fast, with Apple, Google, and Microsoft issuing multiple patches for serious security flaws in June. Enterprise software firms have also been busy, with fixes released for scary holes in VMWare, Cisco, Fortinet, and Progress Software’s MOVEit products. A significant number of security bugs squashed during the month are being used in real-life attacks, so read on, take note, and patch your affected systems as soon as you can. Hot on the heels of iOS 16.5, June saw the release of an emergency iPhone upgrade, iOS 16.5.1. The latest iPhone update fixes security vulnerabilities in WebKit, the engine that underpins Safari, and in the kernel at the heart of the iOS system. Tracked as CVE-2023-32439 and CVE-2023-32434, both issues are code-execution bugs and have been used in real-life attacks, Apple said on its support page. While details about the already exploited flaws are limited, security outfit Kaspersky revealed how the kernel issue was used to perform “iOS Triangulation” attacks against its staff. Impactful because they require no interaction from the user, the “zero click” attacks use an invisible iMessage with a malicious attachment to deliver spyware. Apple has also issued iOS 15.7.7 for older iPhones fixing the Kernel and WebKit issues, as well as a second WebKit flaw tracked as CVE-2023-32435—which was also reported by Kaspersky as part of the iOS Triangulation attacks. Meanwhile, Apple released Safari 16.5.1, macOS Ventura 13.4.1, macOS Monterey 12.6.7, macOS Big Sur 11.7.8 , watchOS 9.5.2 and watchOS 8.8.1. Microsoft’s mid-June Patch Tuesday includes security updates for 78 vulnerabilities, including 28 remote code execution (RCE) bugs. While some of the issues are serious, it is the first Patch Tuesday since March that doesn’t include any already exploited flaws. The critical issues patched in the June update include CVE-2023-29357, an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint Server with a CVSS score of 9.8. “An attacker who has gained access to spoofed JWT authentication tokens can use them to execute a network attack which bypasses authentication and allows them to gain access to the privileges of an authenticated user,” Microsoft said. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian “The attacker needs no privileges, nor does the user need to perform any action,” it added. Meanwhile, CVE-2023-32031 and CVE-2023-28310 are Microsoft Exchange Server remote code execution vulnerabilities that require an attacker to be authenticated to exploit. It’s time to update your Google Android device, as the tech giant has released its June Security Bulletin. The most serious issue fixed by Google is a critical security vulnerability in the System component, tracked as CVE-2023-21108, that could lead to RCE over Bluetooth with no additional execution privileges needed. Another flaw in the System tracked as CVE-2023-21130 is a RCE bug also marked as critical. One of the flaws patched in June’s update is CVE-2022-22706, a vulnerability in Arm components that the chipmaker fixed in 2022 after it had already been used in attacks. The June Android patch also includes CVE-2023-21127, a critical RCE flaw in the framework and CVE-2022-33257 and CVE-2022-40529—two serious bugs in the Qualcomm closed-source components. The Android security update is available for Google’s Pixel phones and is starting to roll out to Samsung’s Galaxy range. Google has released Chrome 114, fixing several serious flaws. The patched bugs include CVE-2023-3214, a critical use-after-free vulnerability in Autofill payments. CVE-2023-3215 is another use-after-free flaw in WebRTC rated as having a high impact, while CVE-2023-3216 is a high severity type confusion bug in V8. A final use-after-free in WebXR is also rated as high. Earlier in the month, Google released a fix for an already exploited type confusion bug, CVE-2023-3079. “Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2023-3079 exists in the wild,” the browser maker said. Right at the end of May, software maker Progress discovered a SQL injection vulnerability in its MOVEit Transfer product that could lead to escalated privileges and unauthorized access. Tracked as CVE-2023-34362, the flaw was used in real-life attacks in May and June 2023. “Depending on the database engine being used, an attacker may be able to infer information about the structure and contents of the database and execute SQL statements that alter or delete database elements,” Progress warned in an advisory. It soon emerged that the attacks were carried out by the Clop ransomware group, which threatened to leak data if victim organizations—which include several US government agencies—didn’t respond by mid-June. However, while researchers at security company Huntress were monitoring exploitation of the flaw, they found additional vulnerabilities, resulting in another patch release. In the second round of patched bugs are SQL injection vulnerabilities tracked as CVE-2023-35036. Then on June 15, a third round of flaws tracked as CVE-2023-35708 emerged, prompting another patch release. Needless to say, if you haven’t patched already, it’s urgent to do so as soon as you can. Software giant VMWare has issued patches for flaws in its Aria Operations for Networks that are already being used in attacks. Tracked as CVE-2023-20887, the first is marked as critical with a CVSS score of 9.8. “A malicious actor with network access to VMware Aria Operations for Networks may be able to perform a command injection attack resulting in remote code execution,” VMWare warned in an advisory. CVE-2023-20888 is an authenticated deserialization vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.1. Meanwhile, CVE-2023-20889 is information disclosure vulnerability in the important severity range with a CVSS score of 8.8. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Later in June, VMWare patched multiple issues in its vCenter Server. Tracked as CVE-2023-20892, the first is a heap overflow vulnerability that could allow an attacker to execute code. CVE-2023-20893 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the implementation of the DCERPC protocol that could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system. CVE-2023-20894 is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability with a CVSS score of 8.1, and CVE-2023-20895 is a memory corruption issue that could allow an attacker to bypass authentication. Cisco has patched a vulnerability in the client update process of its AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Software for Windows and Cisco Secure Client Software for Windows. Tracked as CVE-2023-20178, the flaw could allow a low-privileged, authenticated, local attacker to execute code with System privileges. The fix is especially urgent because security researcher Filip Dragović has recently dropped a proof-of-concept exploit for the flaw. Another notable patch includes CVE-2023-20105, which has a CVSS score of 9.6 and is rated as having a critical impact. The flaw in Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server could allow an attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative read-write user, and then impersonate them. Security firm Fortinet patched a vulnerability in June that it warns is possibly being used in attacks. Tracked as CVE-2023-27997, the heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands via specifically crafted requests. The severity of the flaw is reflected in its CVSS score of 9.8, so make sure you patch it as soon as possible. SAP’s June Patch Day includes fixes for a number of flaws including two rated as having a high severity. The patches include CVE-2021-42063, a cross-site scripting vulnerability in SAP Knowledge Warehouse versions 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50. The flaw could enable unauthorized adversaries to conduct XSS attacks, which could lead to sensitive data disclosure. “This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain user-level access and compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the UI5 Varian Management application,” security company Onapsis said. 📧 Get the best stories from WIRED’s iconic archive in your inbox 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Boots Riley says a “gentler capitalism” won’t save society The last 96 hours of the Titan tragedy Deepfake porn reveals a “pervert’s dilemma” Video game remakes are in a golden age.

Matt Laslo The United States Congress is strange enough without aliens, but here we are. Or is it, here they are? Over a span of several months, members of the 118th Congress have gone from being transfixed by wind-propelled spy balloons to being mesmerized by a whistleblower’s claims that US intelligence officials possess “intact and partially intact non-human aircraft.” The whistleblower, former intelligence officer David Grusch, also claims that this and other evidence are being withheld from Congress. “The allegations themselves are breathtaking,” says Senator Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat. “It could be a game changer, or it could be a crank. I just don't know.” Whether Grusch proves to be a crank or a game changer will likely soon be investigated by lawmakers from both parties and in both chambers of Congress. Skeptics abound, but there are also lawmakers who are curious and open to proof. Then there are the believers. In our strange new political universe of alternative facts turned dystopian reality, once-fringe notions have built-in fan bases in today’s Capitol. And in the House of Representatives, party leaders tapped Grusch’s allies to lead their chamber’s investigation. On one level, it’s fitting that today’s conspiracy-laced Congress—where anti-vaxxers berate scientists, Election 2020 remains disputed, and January 6 rioters are praised as victims—is now tasked with tackling arguably the nation’s most long-standing conspiracy. But many senators fear their House counterpart’s melding of “deep state” with deep space will only sow more confusion into an electorate hungry for answers, which hearings about unidentified aircraft in recent years have failed to satisfactorily answer. The sensational details of Grusch’s claims about so-called unidentified anomalous phenomena (or UAPs—NASA’s new name for UFOs) spread rapidly through the Capitol last week, along with much derision and mockery. Some congressional leaders laughed them off. \"This is not a question I had on my bingo card,” House Democratic Caucus chair Pete Aguilar told the press corps. Or they slid these latest ET allegations right into their old talking points. \"Obviously, we're concerned about Congress being kept in the dark from a lot of these agencies,” House majority leader Steve Scalise replied before even seeing the whistleblower’s claims. The response was different among rank-and-file lawmakers, especially in the House, where the Grusch’s unvetted claims were seen as vindication by a small but vocal—and increasingly powerful—faction of far-right lawmakers who are heading up the inquiry ahead of a planned but still unscheduled hearing. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian “I think it’s a little bit of madness and a whole lot of reality. I do believe we’ve recovered a craft at some point,” Representative Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, told Steve Bannon on his podcast Wednesday. Burchett believes that the Pentagon’s budget is bloated, in part, because it’s funding secret UAP programs. His personal belief in UAPs stems from the 1947 incident in Roswell, New Mexico. When Grusch’s report dropped, some members of today’s far-right immediately suspected it was a false flag planted by the deep state. “We kind of felt, with everything going on, this is like the biggest misdirection play in history,” Bannon told Burchett. Their fears appear to have largely dissipated, however, with Burchett and his far-right allies now all-in on the investigation. Burchett told Bannon he “has a commitment” from both House speaker Kevin McCarthy and House Oversight Committee chair James Comer to hold a hearing on UAPs, though he says it’s not a top priority for party leaders. “We’re only going to get about one bite at the apple,” Burchett said. If the Pentagon—which vigorously denies the whistleblower’s charges of a secret UAP program—or NASA officials ask to brief lawmakers behind closed doors, which is common when classified information is discussed, Burchett’s not interested. “I'm not gonna be a part of it if it's classified. That's ridiculous,” Burchett said on the podcast. “That's just more of the same and creates more myths and rumors than it creates facts.” Burchett is joined by two Florida Republican representatives: Matt Gaetz—“I have seen evidence of craft that I am not familiar with any of our allies or adversaries or even our country possessing”—and Anna Paulina Luna, who believes the government has been lying to the public about UAP’s “for decades.” While Luna and Burchett will likely head up the House inquiry and eventual hearing, it’s not just fringe-right members whose ears perked up over these allegations. This includes Representative Mike McCaul, a Texas Republican and chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “It’s a legitimate issue. On both sides, we just want to know if we've been seeing [UAPs] that are not man-made—is what the article said, but I don't know,” he says. “But that's a good question for the chairman” of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. That’s why one of McCaul’s first reactions to the article was to forward it to the House Intelligence Committee chair, Mike Turner, whose office didn’t reply to multiple requests for comment. The Senate has also shown interest in UAPs in recent years, and the increased pressure on federal officials has produced results—including a massive spike in the number of UAPs the government monitors. In its June 2021 report, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence disclosed 144 UAP sightings stretching back nearly two decades. After years of mounting smartphone evidence, unanswered questions, and frustrated lawmakers, the military unveiled its newly rebooted and renamed All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO; pronounced “arrow”). Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian With a department mandated with tracking secrets in the skies, sightings skyrocketed. Last August, AARO officials disclosed more than 500 reports of UAPs. By this April, there were some 650 cases. And just last month, the Pentagon, which oversees AARO, hiked the number to roughly 800 mysterious flying objects. While Grusch’s claims of alien life and recovered craft have made headlines, senators are alarmed by accusations that the federal government is hiding Special Access Programs from Congress. “We need to just look into whether there are rogue SAP programs that no one is providing oversight for,” says Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat who led the Senate’s April UAP hearing. “The goal for me will be to have a hearing on that at some point so that we can assess if these SAP’s actually exist.” Gillibrand is sponsoring an amendment she hopes to attach to this year’s must-pass National Defense Authorization Act to mandate that no money can be spent on SAP’s unless it's been reported to Congress. “So if there are SAPs out there that are somehow outside of the normal chain of command and outside the normal appropriations process, they have to divulge that to Congress,” Gilibrand says. As for whether she thinks there’s any veracity to the whistleblower’s claims? “I have no idea,” Gillibrand says. “So I'm going to do the work and analyze it and figure it out.” Other senators say there isn’t much to figure out. “Generally, I would look skeptically at many of these reports,” says Senator Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat who serves on the Intelligence Committee. While Heinrich remains dubious of the whistleblower, he says UAPs are a conundrum the federal government must address. “What I take seriously is sometimes we just have these really good, decorated pilots and navigating officers who are experiencing things that we can't explain, so we need to collect data so that we can figure out what is going on,” Heinrich says. Still, among other senators, radio silence. WIRED sent an inquiry to Senate Intelligence Committee chair Mark Warner; in less than a minute, the Virginia Democrat’s staff replied, “We’re a no comment on this—thank you!” When we caught the senator in the Capitol’s marble halls, Warner kept tripping over his own thoughts. “There's been a lot of incoming. Frankly, I just need to find out more information on this,” Warner says. As for the accusation that the federal government has lied to Congress and hidden some SAPs for decades? “We've heard these accusations before,” Warner says, before stopping himself, again. “Let me get some information first.” Lawmakers are still awaiting more answers on the spy balloons that dominated the news—and American air space—at the start of the year, especially in regard to the four objects the Air Force shot down within an eight-day period this February. In the wake of those military engagements, the Biden administration held closed-door classified briefings for members of Congress, but they were less than straightforward, at least initially, until lawmakers pushed officials on UAPs. “They were talking about the balloons, and then several senators pointed out, ‘Now hold on: We’ve had a lot of unidentified anomalous phenomenon for years now,’ and that’s when the military briefer was like, ‘True. True,’” says Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican. “The takeaway from that is, they had thousands of sightings of these things over the years, which was news to me. So I'm not surprised, necessarily, by these latest allegations, because it sounds pretty close to what they kind of grudgingly admitted to us in the briefing.” While not necessarily surprised by Grusch’s claims, lawmakers of all stripes are disturbed by reports of UAPs hovering over US military sites. “It’s not good. None of it’s good,” Hawley says. “I think we want to get to the bottom of this. I think it’s disturbing.” 📩 Don’t miss our biggest stories, delivered to your inbox every day 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future The night 17 million military records went up in smoke The AI protest group campaigning against human extinction How your new car tracks you A grid collapse would make a heat wave far deadlier WIRED’s favorite “buy it for life” gear 🌲 Our Gear team has branched out with a new guide to the best sleeping pads and fresh picks for the best coolers and binoculars Kim Zetter Andy Greenberg Matt Burgess Matt Burgess Lily Hay Newman Tik Root Megan Greenwell Dell Cameron More From WIRED Contact\n"

      "To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Varsha Bansal On the evening of June 11, a journalist from the Kerala-based news portal The Fourth reported that a Telegram bot in a channel called “hak4learn” was offering access to the private data of millions of Indians. All a user had to do was put in a phone number or Aadhaar (India’s national ID) number, and it would return details including their name, passport number, and date of birth. The data appears to have come from India’s CoWIN vaccination tracking app, which has more than 1 billion registered users. “The scale of the data breach is what makes it hard to guess the repercussions,” says Srikanth Lakshmanan, a researcher who runs the digital payments collective Cashless Consumer. “Conservative estimates mean at least personal data of several hundred million users was exposed.” Local news outlets have been able to use the bot to access the personal information of politicians. WIRED couldn’t independently verify their reporting; by the morning of June 12 the bot was inactive. The fact that it has shut down doesn’t mean the breach is over, Lakshmanan says, since the bot was likely just a shop window for whoever accessed the database. “Usually, hackers reveal a slice of data publicly via a bot or web page to prove to the world they have said data and then sell it on the dark web,” Lakshmanan says. “While the bot is down now, we don't know where all the data is being traded.\" India’s digital public infrastructure has expanded massively over the past several years, with the growing popularity of the Aadhaar identity system, the proliferation of the digital payments system United Payments Interface, and the launch of CoWIN. This growth has meant that there is a vast amount of public data on file, but digital rights experts worry that cybersecurity and legal frameworks around data storage haven’t kept pace with the growth. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian “The data involved with government entities is organically very large,” says Tejasi Panjiar, an associate counsel at the Internet Freedom Foundation, an organization that advocates for digital rights. “Which is why there needs to be very strict data-security standards for government-based entities.” Panjiar further said that the concern is that India doesn’t have a cybersecurity policy and that even the current data-protection framework “takes away that aspect of compensation that affected users would get,” making such leaks an even bigger cause for concern. “I think it's a time for worry for everyone who's been vaccinated through CoWIN,” added Panjiar. The health ministry has said that claims that the CoWIN portal has been breached are “without any basis” and that the Computer Emergency Response Team, the agency responsible for responding to cybersecurity incidents, has been asked to investigate. India’s IT minister, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, tweeted that the data accessed by the bot is from a “threat actor database” and that “it does not appear that CoWIN app or database has been directly breached.” An independent report by digital risk monitoring platform CloudSEK seems to validate this to some extent. The company’s research suggests that rather than having access to the entire CoWIN database or backend, the hackers may have instead gotten hold of multiple credentials from health workers, allowing them more limited access to records. “What CloudSEK knows with high confidence is that threat actors have access to multiple credentials that belong to health workers that could be used to access the CoWIN portal for those individual health workers and the data they have access to,” says Rahul Sasi, chief executive of CloudSEK. “What we also speculate is some sort of unauthenticated API that would have allowed attackers to query specific user details. But there is no proof at this point of time.” CoWIN was launched in January 2021 as the foundation of India’s vaccination drive. The platform, which was also available as a mobile app, was used by people to book their vaccination slots and generate a vaccination certificate for themselves and their family members. The government at the time was criticized for making CoWIN the only way for Indians to book a vaccination appointment, excluding millions who didn’t have access to a smartphone or the internet. This isn’t the first time the news of a CoWIN database has surfaced. In 2021, Dark Leak Market, a hacker group, said it had access to the data of 150 million Indians registered on CoWIN. The health ministry denied the claims, saying the platform stores “all the data in a safe and secure digital environment.” At the time, cybersecurity researchers said they suspected the “leak” was a scam. 📨 Understand AI advances with our Fast Forward newsletter 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Meet the psychedelic boom’s first responders Amazon’s new robots roll out an automation revolution ChatGPT’s storytelling chops are no match for D&D How Microsoft Excel tries to rebrand work as excitement Docs show FBI pressures cops to keep phone surveillance secrets 🔌 Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs Dell Cameron Matt Laslo Andy Greenberg Megan Greenwell Lily Hay Newman Dell Cameron Dhruv Mehrotra Andy Greenberg More From WIRED Contact\n",

      "To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Matt Burgess For 25 million North Koreans, the internet is an impossibility. Only a few thousand privileged members of the hermit kingdom’s society can access the global internet, while even the country’s heavily censored internal intranet is out of reach for the majority of the population. Getting access to free and open information isn’t an option. New research from South Korea-based human rights organization People for Successful Corean Reunification (Pscore) details the reality for those who—in very limited circumstances—manage to get online in North Korea. The report reveals a days-long approval process to gain internet access, after which monitors sit next to people while they browse and approve their activities every five minutes. Even then, what can be accessed reveals little about the world outside North Korea’s borders. Documentation from the NGO is being presented today at the human rights conference RightsCon and sheds light on the regime with the most limited internet freedoms, which fall far below the restrictive and surveilled internet access in China and Iran. For millions of people in North Korea, the internet simply doesn’t exist. “I was taught about the World Wide Web, and even had to memorize it for an exam, but I only knew about the internet in theory,” one North Korean defector who left the country told Pscore researchers. “I knew it was a sort of network where you can search but didn’t actually know what it was.” Another said they didn’t “know the concept of Wi-Fi,” let alone have any clue about Google. Getting an accurate picture of what happens within Kim Jong Un’s sealed-off state is incredibly challenging. Officials control all information flows and present state propaganda to the world. Analysts turn to those who escape and defect, at great personal risk, for a glimpse of North Korean reality. Pscore’s internet freedom report is based on 24 face-to-face interviews with defectors and a survey of 158 others. All left North Korea between 2012 and 2022. The report says North Korean researcher Kim Suk-Han—all defector names within the research are pseudonyms for safety reasons—used the internet five times when they were living in the country. They had used the internet while on a trip to China and so had high expectations, they told the researchers. Instead, they faced limited access and constant surveillance. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian “A librarian sits between two internet users and continuously monitors what people on both sides are searching up,” Kim said in testimony to the researchers. “Every five minutes, the screen freezes automatically, and the librarian must do a fingerprint authentication to allow further internet use.” A state security officer was also always nearby, they said. People were allowed to use the internet for an hour, and if someone wanted more time, they would need to obtain new permission, Kim said. It took around two days to get permission from authorities to use the internet, a task requiring approvals from various officials. If someone applied too often, they would be made to wait, Kim said. “Every Korean website is blocked, and only Chinese or English websites are available.” Over the past decade, there has been an increased number of digital devices in North Korea. Around 50 to 80 percent of adults may now have mobile phones, allowing them to text and call family members. Yet the use of these phones is highly controlled—data speeds are low, with devices capturing screenshots every few minutes and code that only allows government-approved content to be shown. And internet penetration is at nowhere near the same level. “North Korean people cannot use it, not because of the infrastructure or not because of the country’s poor conditions,” says Nam Bada, the secretary general of Pscore and editor of the report. “It is only because of the governmental policy.” A few dozen families with connections to Kim Jong-Un and some foreigners have unrestricted access to the global internet, while a “few thousand” people—including government officials, researchers, and students studying IT—can access a surveillance-heavy version of it, according to the report and previous research. North Koreans like Kim who are allowed some foreign travel, usually for business, can sometimes access the global web while abroad. Mitch Haszard, a senior threat intelligence analyst at security firm Recorded Future, which has previously analyzed North Korean internet traffic, says Chinese and Russian internet service providers hook the country up to the global network, and access by foreign visitors makes up some of what can be seen externally. This may have changed during the Covid-19 pandemic when there were fewer foreigners in North Korea and its borders were closed. According to multiple defectors quoted in the Pscore report, global internet access is only available in certain locations and buildings within North Korea. One person claimed internet connections at the National Academy of Sciences in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, were only available on the second floor, and just eight computers were connected. Around five people were granted use, they said. Another defector told the Pscore researchers that when they got permission to travel to Pyongyang to use the internet, they tried to download medical research papers but could only access the titles of the papers and the author names. “I knew the concept of the global internet when I was in North Korea, but I didn’t know that so much information was exchanged through it,” said Shin Yong-Rok, another defector. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Martyn Williams is a senior fellow with the Stimson Center and 38 North project who has extensively studied technology in North Korea but was not involved with the report. Williams says the testimonies track with those of other defectors but add new details about the levels of surveillance people face. In general, Williams says, internet access “appears to be available for officially sanctioned uses, such as some universities, research establishments, and likely some trade organizations and other establishments.” University students Williams spoke to have previously said that they are required to state why they need to use the internet and are monitored when they get online. Williams points to a 2020 North Korean law that has ramped up the country’s efforts to stop foreign information from being accessed in the country. In recent years, outside information—including TV shows and South Korean content—has been smuggled across the border using USB drives, giving people a glimpse of the outside world. “The new law levies harsh penalties, up to and including death, on people caught with foreign information,” Williams says. (In 2021 it was reported that a man who smuggled copies of the dystopian Netflix thriller Squid Game into North Korea and sold them was sentenced to death.) While tightly controlled access to the internet is available for a few thousand “elites,” the local intranet is marginally more accessible—in theory, at least. Known as Kwangmyong, the intranet offers only a handful of websites. “Citizens can access [the intranet] from their phones or from computers,” Williams says. “Over the years, we’ve seen lots of websites shown and offered, and it appears that many major sectors of the government have their own sites with official information.” Some online shopping has recently become available, according to reports. Defectors told Pscore that intranet prices were generally too high for most people, meaning a lot of access happens at official buildings, such as universities and libraries, where surveillance levels are high. People willing to take the risk can try to get around the system. “I’ve secretly played the game [Dota] twice through the intranet with people in another region,” said one defector, given the pseudonym Jung Woo-Jin. “I’ve only played three times. If you play more, your IP will be exposed by using more than a certain time, then your place will be recorded.” Most people included in the study said intranet use is impractical. Pscore’s report lists around two dozen recommendations, addressed to both North Korea and international countries, for improving internet freedom. The report pushes for more connectivity within the country, advising North Korea to stop monitoring people and to connect the intranet to the global internet. If a full internet connection cannot be provided, a censored model like China’s would be a better last resort, the report says. The report adds that countries should work to create a “legal framework” for international access and recognize internet access as a law-backed human right. Nam, the Pscore secretary general, says increasing internet access could benefit health care and education and improve people’s human rights, such as freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. Globally, 5.3 billion people regularly use the internet, or around 66 percent of Earth’s population. For years, official bodies have declared internet access to be a human right—with the United Nations saying there should be full connectivity by 2030. “The real problem is how to translate these commitments into reality,” says Barbora Bukovská, senior director of law and policy at human rights organization Article 19. “This includes issues such as making the internet affordable, getting people online, acquiring minimum digital skills and literacy, or achieving equality in access for marginalized groups and those at risk of discrimination.” Bukovská says North Korea’s human rights record indicates that mandating internet access at a global level would likely not make much difference—bigger change within the country would be needed to implement such changes. But for those who have managed to leave the country, the difference is stark. “People will long for any new information, such as science and technology information,” defector Kim Suk-Han told researchers, “which are accessible through the internet.” 📧 Get the best stories from WIRED’s iconic archive in your inbox 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Boots Riley says a “gentler capitalism” won’t save society The last 96 hours of the Titan tragedy Deepfake porn reveals a “pervert’s dilemma” Video game remakes are in a golden age.

Thor Benson Artificial intelligence is arguably the most rapidly advancing technology humans have ever developed. A year ago you wouldn’t often hear AI come up in a regular conversation, but today it seems there’s constant talk about how generative AI tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E will affect the future of work, the spread of information, and more. A major question that has thus far been almost entirely unexamined is how this AI-dominated future will affect people’s minds. There’s been some research into how using AI in their jobs will affect people mentally, but there isn’t yet an understanding of how simply living amongst so much AI-generated content and systems will affect people’s sense of the world. How is AI going to change individuals and society in the not-too-distant future? AI will obviously make it easier to produce disinformation—from fake images to deepfakes to fake news. That will affect people’s sense of trust as they’re scrolling on social media. AI can also allow someone to imitate your loved ones, which further erodes people’s general ability to trust what was once unquestionable. That may also affect how they think about identity. Your own identity can be threatened by deepfakes, too, if people are creating images or videos of you doing things you never actually did. In the US, people often identify with their jobs, and those could soon be threatened. Will AI make people more reliant on and distracted by technology at a time when that’s already a major issue? There are countless ways AI could reshape how people operate in the world. But researchers are only just beginning to grapple with the implications of an AI-saturated existence. Larry Rosen, a professor emeritus of psychology at California State University, Dominguez Hills, says he worries that AI will make people more reliant on technology. Humans like things to be as simple and easy as possible, to avoid stress, he says, so people might start automating every aspect of their life that they can. In the same way you might use Google Maps to get everywhere and not know how to get there otherwise, AI might cause people to stop learning things they would have otherwise had to learn. Ironically, though, Rosen thinks this could cause more stress as people are inundated with AI and constantly shifting gears and not seeing anything quite clearly. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian “I get concerned about the fact that we just blindly believe the GPS. We don’t question it. Are we just going to blindly believe the AI?” Rosen says. “As it is, we’re overwhelmed. We’re so overwhelmed that we can’t make ourselves do a simple task and see it to completion. Anxiety is just going to ratchet up as we’re faced with this unknown thing in our world.” Michael Graziano, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Princeton University, says he thinks AI could create a “post-truth world.” He says it will likely make it significantly easier to convince people of false narratives, which will be disruptive in many ways. “Reality has become pixels, and pixels are now infinitely inventable,” Graziano says. “We can create them any way we want to.” That being said, Graziano also wonders if AI could help us with the loneliness epidemic, which is a big strain on mental health. Perhaps people will think of AI as a friend? But what happens then? We don’t yet know, Graziano says. “We don’t actually know what kind of impact this technology will have,” Graziano says. Michal Kosinski, a computational psychologist and associate professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University, says AI could have an interesting impact on how people think about their work. He says AI will be better at doing many tasks that humans do today, so people will rely on it, and they could essentially become the human face of the work the AI is doing. “Increasingly, not only medical doctors but politicians and judges and teachers will become interfaces for algorithms,” Kosinki says. “When you go to a doctor, a doctor will still give you a diagnosis, but this diagnosis will just be printed out of a computer that analyzed your vital signs and symptoms and told the doctor to give you this medicine.” AI is going to have an impact on almost every aspect of human life, and Graziano says much more research is needed into how this will affect people’s minds. If social media can have such a major impact on society, there’s no telling what consequences a rapidly advancing technology like AI could precipitate. “I would like to see people collect actual data on people’s psychological state, personalities, their mental health as a function of their engagement with AI,” Graziano says. “What does that do? Does it actually improve things in some ways and harm things in other ways? Is it dependent on the particular personality or particular socio-economic status of a person? There’s this giant area that isn’t studied.” Kosinki says people are just starting to see how quickly these AI systems are advancing, and they’re just going to keep becoming more complex and capable of more things. The world might look a lot different in just a year, and there’s no saying what it will look like further down the road. “We are sliding, very quickly, towards an AI-controlled and AI-dominated world,” Kosinki says. 📨 Understand AI advances with our Fast Forward newsletter 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Meet the psychedelic boom’s first responders Amazon’s new robots roll out an automation revolution ChatGPT’s storytelling chops are no match for D&D How Microsoft Excel tries to rebrand work as excitement Docs show FBI pressures cops to keep phone surveillance secrets 🔌 Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs Kim Zetter Matt Burgess Matt Burgess Lily Hay Newman Andy Greenberg Tik Root Megan Greenwell Dell Cameron More From WIRED Contact\n",

Lily Hay Newman In December, Apple announced that it was killing a controversial iCloud photo-scanning tool the company had devised to combat child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in what it said was a privacy-preserving way. Apple then said that its anti-CSAM efforts would instead center around its “Communication Safety” features for children, initially announced in August 2021. And at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference in Cupertino today, Apple debuted expansions to the mechanism, including an additional feature tailored to adults. Communication Safety scans messages locally on young users' devices to flag content that children are receiving or sending in messages on iOS that contain nudity. Apple announced today that the feature is also expanding to FaceTime video messages, Contact Posters in the Phone app, the Photos picker tool where users choose photos or videos to send, and AirDrop. The feature's on-device processing means that Apple never sees the content being flagged, but beginning this fall, Communication Safety will be turned on by default for all child accounts—kids under 13—in a Family Sharing plan. Parents can elect to disable the feature if they choose. “Communication Safety is a feature where we really want to give the child a moment to pause and hopefully get disrupted out of what is effectively a grooming conversation, or at least might be,” says Apple's head of user privacy, Erik Neuenschwander. “So it’s meant to be high-friction. It’s meant to be that there is an answer which we think is likely right in that child’s situation, which is not to move forward, and we really want to make sure they’re educated.” Apple said in December that it planned to make an application programming interface (API) available so third-party developers could easily integrate Communication Safety into their apps and use it to detect child sexual abuse material, or CSAM. The API, known as the Sensitive Content Analysis framework, is available now for developers. Platforms like Discord have already said that they plan to incorporate it into their iOS apps. A Communication Safety prompt for a child's account. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian One criticism of anti-CSAM initiatives like Communication Safety is that they don't have full coverage across apps and services to flag content and protect children everywhere, potentially allowing communications with abusers to slip through. And this is precisely why Apple says it invested heavily to develop a robust API that app makers can easily incorporate into their software. “There was a lot of work that we had to do to create this model,” Neuenschwander says. “We can make that investment once and then have that be leveraged across the platform for potentially all of the applications our users use.” An opt-in Sensitive Content Warning for an adult's account. On top of Communication Safety, Apple says it has also received feedback about interest in a version of the feature for adults. So today, the company also launched Sensitive Content Warning, which similarly uses local scanning to flag and blur images and videos that contain nudity. The feature is optional and is controlled in the iOS Privacy & Security settings menu. And it's designed to be more subtle than Communication Safety. The goal is to protect adult users from content they don't want to see without being intrusive or unhelpful. Meaningfully addressing and reducing child sexual abuse online is a complicated and difficult problem. And Apple says it isn't done exploring and investing in new solutions. But with such high stakes, there's real urgency for a company like Apple to roll out features that will have an impact and promote their adoption as widely as possible. 📧 Get the best stories from WIRED’s iconic archive in your inbox 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Boots Riley says a “gentler capitalism” won’t save society The last 96 hours of the Titan tragedy Deepfake porn reveals a “pervert’s dilemma” Video game remakes are in a golden age.

Matt Burgess Code hidden inside PC motherboards left millions of machines vulnerable to malicious updates, researchers revealed this week. Staff at security firm Eclypsium found code within hundreds of models of motherboards created by Taiwanese manufacturer Gigabyte that allowed an updater program to download and run another piece of software. While the system was intended to keep the motherboard updated, the researchers found that the mechanism was implemented insecurely, potentially allowing attackers to hijack the backdoor and install malware. Elsewhere, Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky revealed that its staff had been targeted by newly discovered zero-click malware impacting iPhones. Victims were sent a malicious message, including an attachment, on Apple’s iMessage. The attack automatically started exploiting multiple vulnerabilities to give the attackers access to devices, before the message deleted itself. Kaspersky says it believes the attack impacted more people than just its own staff. On the same day as Kaspersky revealed the iOS attack, Russia’s Federal Security Service, also known as the FSB, claimed thousands of Russians had been targeted by new iOS malware and accused the US National Security Agency (NSA) of conducting the attack. The Russian intelligence agency also claimed Apple had helped the NSA. The FSB did not publish technical details to support its claims, and Apple said it has never inserted a backdoor into its devices. If that’s not enough encouragement to keep your devices updated, we’ve rounded up all the security patches issued in May. Apple, Google, and Microsoft all released important patches last month—go and make sure you're up to date. And there’s more. Each week we round up the security stories we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. Lina Khan, the chair of the US Federal Trade Commission, warned this week that the agency is seeing criminals using artificial intelligence tools to “turbocharge” fraud and scams. The comments, which were made in New York and first reported by Bloomberg, cited examples of voice-cloning technology where AI was being used to trick people into thinking they were hearing a family member’s voice. Recent machine-learning advances have made it possible for people’s voices to be imitated with only a few short clips of training data—although experts say AI-generated voice clips can vary widely in quality. In recent months, however, there has been a reported rise in the number of scam attempts apparently involving generated audio clips. Khan said that officials and lawmakers “need to be vigilant early” and that while new laws governing AI are being considered, existing laws still apply to many cases. In a rare admission of failure, North Korean leaders said that the hermit nation’s attempt to put a spy satellite into orbit didn’t go as planned this week. They also said the country would attempt another launch in the future. On May 31, the Chollima-1 rocket, which was carrying the satellite, launched successfully, but its second stage failed to operate, causing the rocket to plunge into the sea. The launch triggered an emergency evacuation alert in South Korea, but this was later retracted by officials. The satellite would have been North Korea’s first official spy satellite, which experts say would give it the ability to monitor the Korean Peninsula. The country has previously launched satellites, but experts believe they have not sent images back to North Korea. The failed launch comes at a time of high tensions on the peninsula, as North Korea continues to try to develop high-tech weapons and rockets. In response to the launch, South Korea announced new sanctions against the Kimsuky hacking group, which is linked to North Korea and is said to have stolen secret information linked to space development. In recent years, Amazon has come under scrutiny for lax controls on people’s data. This week the US Federal Trade Commission, with the support of the Department of Justice, hit the tech giant with two settlements for a litany of failings concerning children’s data and its Ring smart home cameras. In one instance, officials say, a former Ring employee spied on female customers in 2017—Amazon purchased Ring in 2018—viewing videos of them in their bedrooms and bathrooms. The FTC says Ring had given staff “dangerously overbroad access” to videos and had a “lax attitude toward privacy and security.” In a separate statement, the FTC said Amazon kept recordings of kids using its voice assistant Alexa and did not delete data when parents requested it. The FTC ordered Amazon to pay around $30 million in response to the two settlements and introduce some new privacy measures. Perhaps more consequentially, the FTC said that Amazon should delete or destroy Ring recordings from before March 2018 as well as any “models or algorithms” that were developed from the data that was improperly collected. The order has to be approved by a judge before it is implemented. Amazon has said it disagrees with the FTC, and it denies “violating the law,” but it added that the “settlements put these matters behind us.” As companies around the world race to build generative AI systems into their products, the cybersecurity industry is getting in on the action. This week OpenAI, the creator of text- and image-generating systems ChatGPT and Dall-E, opened a new program to work out how AI can best be used by cybersecurity professionals. The project is offering grants to those developing new systems. OpenAI has proposed a number of potential projects, ranging from using machine learning to detect social engineering efforts and producing threat intelligence to inspecting source code for vulnerabilities and developing honeypots to trap hackers. While recent AI developments have been faster than many experts predicted, AI has been used in the cybersecurity industry for several years—although many claims don’t necessarily live up to the hype. The US Air Force is moving quickly on testing artificial intelligence in flying machines—in January, it tested a tactical aircraft being flown by AI. However, this week, a new claim started circulating: that during a simulated test, a drone controlled by AI started to “attack” and “killed” a human operator overseeing it, because they were stopping it from accomplishing its objectives. “The system started realizing that while they did identify the threat, at times the human operator would tell it not to kill that threat, but it got its points by killing that threat,” said Colnel Tucker Hamilton, according to a summary of an event at the Royal Aeronautical Society, in London. Hamilton continued to say that when the system was trained to not kill the operator, it started to target the communications tower the operator was using to communicate with the drone, stopping its messages from being sent. However, the US Air Force says the simulation never took place. Spokesperson Ann Stefanek said the comments were “taken out of context and were meant to be anecdotal.” Hamilton has also clarified that he “misspoke” and he was talking about a “thought experiment.” Despite this, the described scenario highlights the unintended ways that automated systems could bend rules imposed on them to achieve the goals they have been set to achieve. Called specification gaming by researchers, other instances have seen a simulated version of Tetris pause the game to avoid losing, and an AI game character killed itself on level one to avoid dying on the next level.

      "To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. By Dhruv Mehrotra On a Wednesday morning in May, Hannah got a call from her lawyer—there was a warrant out for her husband’s arrest. Her thoughts went straight to her kids. They were going to come home from school and their father would be gone. “It burned me,” Hannah says, her voice breaking. “He hasn’t done anything to get his bond revoked, and they couldn’t prove he had.” Hannah’s husband is now awaiting trial in jail, in part because of an anti-pornography app called Covenant Eyes. The company explicitly says the app is not meant for use in criminal proceedings, but the probation department in Indiana’s Monroe County has been using it for the past month to surveil not only Hannah’s husband but also the devices of everyone in their family. To protect their privacy, WIRED is not disclosing their surname or the names of individual family members. Hannah agreed to use her nickname. Prosecutors in Monroe County this spring charged Hannah’s husband with possession of child sexual abuse material—a serious crime that she says he did not commit and to which he pleaded not guilty. Given the nature of the charges, the court ordered that he not have access to any electronic devices as a condition of his pretrial release from jail. To ensure he complied with those terms, the probation department installed Covenant Eyes on Hannah’s phone, as well as those of her two children and her mother-in-law. In near real time, probation officers are being fed screenshots of everything Hannah’s family views on their devices. From images of YouTube videos watched by her 14-year-old daughter to online underwear purchases made by her 80-year-old mother-in-law, the family’s entire digital life is scrutinized by county authorities. “I’m afraid to even communicate with our lawyer,” Hannah says. “If I mention anything about our case, I’m worried they are going to see it and use it against us.” Covenant Eyes is part of a multimillion-dollar market of “accountability” apps sold to churches and parents as a tool to police online activity. For a monthly fee, the app monitors every single thing a user does on their devices, then sends the data it collects, including screenshots, to an “ally” or “accountability partner,” who can review the user’s online activities. For Hannah’s family, their Covenant Eyes “allies” are two probation officers in Monroe County’s Pretrial Services Program charged with scrutinizing their web activity and ensuring that Hannah’s husband does not violate the terms of his bond while using one of his family members’ devices. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Covenant Eyes doesn’t permit its software to be used in a “premeditated legal setting,” such as monitoring people on probation, according to its terms of service. But public spending documents, court records, and interviews show that courts in at least five US states have used Covenant Eyes to surveil the devices of people who are awaiting trial or released on parole. Neither Covenant Eyes nor multiple officials in Monroe County responded to repeated requests for comment and detailed questions about the app’s monitoring. While the use of Covenant Eyes in a criminal-legal setting likely only represents a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of people under court-ordered electronic surveillance, the stakes are still high for those required to use it. The app’s accuracy could determine whether a loved one lives at home or behind bars. Legal experts say that its use raises serious constitutional and due process concerns. “This is the most extreme type of monitoring that I’ve seen,” says Pilar Weiss, founder of the National Bail Fund Network, a network of over 90 community bail and bond funds across the United States. “It’s part of a disturbing trend where deep surveillance and social control applications are used pretrial with little oversight.” The Covenant Eyes app was developed by Michael Holm, a former National Security Agency mathematician who now works as a data scientist for the company. It captures everything visible on a device’s screen, taking at least one screenshot per minute. It then analyzes the screenshots locally before slightly blurring them and saving them on a server. Images the system marks as possibly “explicit” are flagged for further review. For example, one Covenant Eyes report sent to Hannah’s husband's probation officer, which WIRED reviewed, flagged an online advertisement for a back brace that included a woman in a tank top as “potentially concerning.” The app also monitors every network request a device makes, blocking allegedly pornographic content and alerting allies about requests the software deems suspicious. The day her husband was released on bond, Hannah sat down with their kids and tried to explain how all of their devices were going to be monitored: The probation department would see anything they looked at on their phones and assume it was their father using the device. The constant surveillance had an immediate impact on the family, Hannah says. Hannah began skipping her online therapy sessions, fearing that the probation officers would snoop on what she told her doctor. She says her 12-year-old son approached her a half-dozen times to ask things like, “Mom, will Pocket Mortys get dad in trouble?” Her daughter was afraid to text with her friends, worrying that if she used bad language, her father could end up in jail. “It was like the family was being charged with a crime,” Hannah says. “It felt like entrapment.” While the images in the Covenant Eyes reports that WIRED reviewed are partially blurred, it is sometimes possible to discern sensitive information from them. For instance, one Covenant Eyes report shows a screenshot of Hannah’s mother-in-law’s device while a phone call was in progress. The report clearly shows the name of the person being contacted. Another shows screenshots of Hannah’s mother-in-law’s bank statements and her Gmail inbox, although the sensitive details in both are unreadable. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Covenant Eyes doesn’t just block pornography. Though the app is designed to block traffic to adult sites, Hannah shared reports that show she was unable to access The Appeal, a nonprofit news organization that focuses on injustice in the criminal-legal system. Molly Greene, The Appeal’s strategy and legal director, calls the censorship alarming. “It’s incredibly concerning to hear readers say they can no longer access our website as a result of this app,” she says. ​​“This kind of abuse of judicial power to restrict people’s autonomy and ability to access critical information on the criminal legal system is exactly why The Appeal exists.” Less than a week after Covenant Eyes was installed on the four phones in her household, Hannah got a call from her husband’s probation officer saying that her husband had violated the terms of his bond. According to Hannah, the officer said Covenant Eyes detected that her phone had visited Pornhub. Court records WIRED reviewed cite a visit to the adult website as the reason for revoking his bond. But Hannah claims that her husband didn’t touch her phone and that no one had visited Pornhub. Instead, she says, her phone had made a network request to the website’s servers as part of a background app refresh from a frequently visited tab on her Chrome browser. WIRED tested Hannah’s claims that Covenant Eyes flags background network activity from websites that aren’t intentionally viewed. Using an iPhone, we visited Pornhub enough times that it was a frequently visited tab on Google Chrome. We then installed Covenant Eyes and restarted our phone. Within minutes, Covenant Eyes alerted our designated accountability partner that a request to Pornhub was made from our test device, even though we never touched it. This is a known issue with Covenant Eyes. The alert Covenant Eyes sent when it detected a network request to Pornhub explicitly stated that the software cannot determine if the user “intentionally viewed” the webpage because “some apps generate activity in the background without the member’s consent.” The company has public documentation about the shortcoming. This limitation in Covenant Eyes means it’s possible Hannah’s husband did not violate the terms of his bond. Moreover, the terms of her husband’s bond don’t prohibit Hannah from looking at pornography, and it would be impossible for probation officers to know who was using the device from Covenant Eyes reports alone. Yet, in the motion to revoke Hannah’s husband’s bond, the only evidence prosecutors presented was information from the Covenant Eyes report. According to Kate Weisburd, an associate professor at George Washington University School of Law, challenging probation and parole violations is difficult, particularly when they’re based on electronic evidence. Courts are largely reluctant to find due process problems with electronic surveillance, she says, and overworked defense attorneys often lack the capacity to bring a challenge. Hannah printed the Covenant Eyes documentation and hand-delivered it to the prosecutors, the judge, and the probation department. She never heard back. As a last resort, Hannah emailed Covenant Eyes CEO Ron DeHaas. In an email exchange Hannah shared with WIRED, DeHaas was apologetic. “Hannah, I’m sorry that you are going through this,” DeHaas wrote. “I will have our legal department follow up with you.” Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Hannah says the legal department never reached out. Jonathan Manes, an attorney at the MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office, says the surveillance Hannah’s family faces likely violates several of their constitutional rights. “This feels like an extraordinarily intrusive violation of the family’s First Amendment rights to be able to access the internet and communicate without being monitored,” he says. Manes adds that because the software effectively enables continuous and suspicionless searches of the devices of people who haven’t been charged with a crime, the family’s Fourth Amendment rights were potentially violated. Lastly, Manes points out that by indiscriminately surveilling whatever the phone is displaying, the app could collect sensitive data that includes the family’s communications with their lawyers, as Hannah feared. “It’s interfering with his right to speak in confidence with his attorney,” he says of Hannah’s husband. “It’s impeding his ability to prepare a defense and exercise that Sixth Amendment right.” “This strikes me as quite chilling,” Manes adds. “It’s what happens when someone’s home becomes their jail cell, and now everyone they live with is subject to the same kind of surveillance as the person who is charged.” Several legal experts expressed concern about the monitoring conditions imposed by the judge in Hannah’s husband’s case. But Phyllis Emerick, the chief deputy public defender in Monroe County, argues that because Hannah’s husband and his family consented to the surveillance, they gave up their rights to privacy. “He agreed that he would not access electronic devices in his household in exchange for release,” she says. “It was the family’s choice to continue living with him.” Weiss, of the National Bail Fund Network, disagrees with the idea that any type of surveillance is permissible so long as a person agrees to it to avoid jail time. “Sure, they consented to this, but it’s at the barrel of a gun,” she says. The exact number of individuals or families in Monroe County who have been required to use Covenant Eyes as part of their pretrial release is unclear. In the county’s annual report from 2021, the Probation Department stated that they provided pretrial monitoring for 618 individuals; however, the report does not provide details about the specific type of monitoring involved. The number of individuals who were assigned to be monitored by Covenant Eyes is likely a small percentage of that. Deputy probation officer Troy Hatfield would not answer specific questions about either Covenant Eyes or Hannah’s husband’s case, but he says the conditions of any defendant’s supervision are ultimately decided by the judge based on the specific facts of each case and department policy. Neither Monroe’s chief probation officer, Linda Brady, nor the judge in Hannah’s husband’s case, Mary Ellen Diekhoff, responded to repeated requests for interviews. It’s also unclear exactly how many jurisdictions in the US have used Covenant Eyes. Court records WIRED reviewed show that courts in Washington, Montana, and Ohio have each ordered a defendant to use the software at least once. In all of these cases, the defendant faced charges related to child sexual abuse material or child exploitation. In Colorado, spending records show that the State Judicial Branch has purchased services from Covenant Eyes 60 times since 2017. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Multiple probation officer associations, public defense organizations, and bail funds WIRED contacted had never heard of the software and were unfamiliar with any screen-monitoring software being used for pretrial monitoring. Independent legal experts who spoke to WIRED say that the use of an app like Covenant Eyes stems from a lack of oversight over how courts deploy punitive surveillance technology and judges’ broad authority to impose monitoring conditions without real accountability. “There’s a black box around how all of this technology works and is deployed,” says Weisburd, of George Washington University. “We don’t know error rates, how the technology operates, or even if it’s reliable.” This leaves people vulnerable to faulty technology in high-stakes situations where their freedom hinges on the word of an app. This includes Hannah’s husband, who remains in jail based on an automated report from an app that is not meant to be used in criminal proceedings and is known to produce false positives. Hannah, meanwhile, is afraid to stop paying $18.99 a month for a subscription with Covenant Eyes, which is still installed on some of her family’s devices, recording everything they do. Update 1:40 pm ET, June 26, 2023: Following publication, Judge Mary Ellen Diekhoff ordered Hannah's husband released from jail under an Amended Order of Pretrial Release issued on June 21, according to court records WIRED reviewed. Hannah says she, her children, and her mother-in-law are no longer under surveillance. 📨 Understand AI advances with our Fast Forward newsletter 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Meet the psychedelic boom’s first responders Amazon’s new robots roll out an automation revolution ChatGPT’s storytelling chops are no match for D&D How Microsoft Excel tries to rebrand work as excitement Docs show FBI pressures cops to keep phone surveillance secrets 🔌 Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs Lily Hay Newman Kim Zetter Andy Greenberg Matt Burgess Matt Burgess Tik Root Megan Greenwell Dell Cameron More From WIRED Contact\n"

      "To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Matt Burgess Your car knows a lot about you. Over the past decade, vehicles have become increasingly connected and their ability to record data about us has shot up. Cars can track where you’re traveling to and from, record every press on the accelerator as well as your seatbelt settings, and gather biometric information about you. Some of this data is sold by the murky data-broker industry. In May, US-based automotive firm Privacy4Cars released a new tool, dubbed the Vehicle Privacy Report, that reveals how much information on your car can be hoovered up. Much like Apple and Google’s privacy labels for apps—which show how Facebook might use your camera, or how Uber might use your location data—the tool indicates what vehicle manufacturers can know. Using industry sales data, WIRED ran 10 of the most popular cars in the US through the privacy tool to see just how much information they can collect. Spoiler: It’s a lot. The analysis follows previous reporting on the amount of data modern cars can collect and share—with estimates saying cars can produce 25 gigabytes of data per hour. Andrea Amico, the founder of Privacy4Cars, says people understand very little about what data their cars can collect as there is little education and “the level of detail and transparency varies” across manufacturers. His tool ranks most modern vehicles as “smartphones on wheels,” as they’re able to collect heaps of data and wirelessly send that information to manufacturers. The Vehicle Privacy Report creates privacy labels under two broad categories: what a manufacturer collects (including identifiers, biometrics, location, data from synced phones, and user profiles) and whom a manufacturer sells or shares data with (affiliates, service providers, insurance firms, government, and data brokers). For the vast majority of cars and trucks released in the past few years, it’s likely that most types of data are collected. The tool works by using your car’s Vehicle Identification Number, or VIN, and also analyzes each manufacturer’s public policy documents. We gathered publicly available VINs for a selection of vehicles produced in 2022—from Toyota, Honda, Ford, Chevrolet, Ram, and Jeep—and ran them through the tool, also comparing the results with the original documents. The results only apply to the US, as different laws apply in other countries. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian The documents can include privacy statements, terms of service, and connected vehicle policies. Recent models from a manufacturer often gather the same data as other cars in the manufacturer's lineup, as they are governed by the same policies. Generally, all manufacturers will provide data to the government or law enforcement when it has a legal request to do so. These lengthy documents are often technical legal files, which can be difficult to understand, but also can contain nuances. They also explain why data is collected; some may be gathered for research or product development, while other information could be used for personalizing marketing. For instance, you need to provide your location data for mapping and satellite navigation services to work. And not all data a privacy policy says is collected may be gathered by default—certain settings may need to be turned on by the driver, for instance—and in some cases, it is possible to opt out of information being collected. Four Toyota models were in our pick of the most popular US vehicles in recent years: the Toyota Tacoma, Toyota Camry, Toyota RAV4, and Toyota Highlander. As with all of the vehicles in this article, the privacy documentation analyzed by the Vehicle Privacy Tool is the same for each 2022 model—some older cars may collect less data. Broadly, all manufacturers are likely to collect personal information that can be classed as an identifier. These include your name, address, driving license number, phone number, email, and other information. Toyota is no different. The Privacy4Cars tool analyzed four publicly available documents from Toyota, which total around 31,000 words. One key document is the company’s connected services privacy notice, which details what information your car may collect. As well as information about who you are, Toyota can also collect your “driving behavior.” This includes information such as your “acceleration and speed, steering, and braking functionality, and travel direction.” It may also gather your in-vehicle preferences, favorite locations saved on its systems, and images gathered by external cameras or sensors. Some models of Toyota can also scan your face for face recognition when you enter one of its vehicles. Corey Proffitt, a senior manager for connected communications at Toyota, says this can verify a driver’s identity and the profile that is stored on a vehicle. “This data is not readable by humans, and any facial features are only stored on the vehicle and not transmitted to Toyota,” Proffitt says. The Vehicle Privacy Tool says Toyota’s documents are “silent” on whether the company collects data from people’s phones that are synced with its vehicles. Proffitt says it doesn’t collect this data, except for “using an identifier for the sole purpose of connecting a user’s profile on the Toyota/Lexus app with a vehicle” if a profile has been set up. “Any synchronization of contact info and call history for Bluetooth purposes remains on the vehicle and is not sent to Toyota,” Proffitt says. They say people can “turn off all data transmission on their vehicle.” To do this, you can decline consent for connected services on its privacy hub or contact Toyota customer service. As with other manufacturers, Honda collects personally identifying information, such as contact information, Social Security numbers, driving license details, and your location. This all broadly falls into a category that Honda calls “covered information”—essentially information that’s gathered about you. Chris Martin, regulatory, legal, and new technology communications manager at Honda, says it is difficult to distill how data is collected and used by Honda into a few sentences because of various different laws that apply and different reasons why some data may be collected. Martin points to Honda’s Vehicle Data Privacy Practices document for the full picture and descriptions of how data is being used. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Using the Privacy4Cars tool, we looked at Honda CR-V and Civic models. Honda can collect information about your vehicle (such as fuel levels, tire pressure, and battery charge status); trip log information (such as when you start and end a journey); and airbag system status. There is also information about how you use the connected elements of your vehicle—such as search content, call history information, and voice commands (which could include audio recording). Driver behavior information can include pedal position, engine speed, and steering angle, among other things. There’s also “on-board data,” which is information that is generated by your car but “generally” not sent to Honda. This is information that’s stored in your car and could be accessed by someone plugging in external data extraction tools, such as a technician. Honda’s documentation says this could include information about how your car is used, driver behavior information, or contacts and messages sent using the systems. Privacy4Cars results say it is unclear how Honda uses biometric data, which is information about your body. Honda’s Martin says no Acura or Honda models in the US have systems that transfer biometrics to the company. The airbag system within the car may collect weight and body position information, Martin says, but this is stored on the onboard computer and is only accessible by a physical connection, with state and federal laws outlining who can access it. Honda’s connected product privacy notice says it is possible to opt out of many forms of data collection, pointing to its apps and owners manuals. Only one Ford model, the F150 truck, appears in recent lists of best-sellers, but it's often the most popular across all categories. Like most manufacturers, Ford collects information about who owns the vehicle, including names, location details, and driving license data. Privacy4Cars analyzed four Ford documents, which run to around 50,000 words, when looking at the data the company can collect. Alan Hall, director of technology communications at Ford, says its Connected Vehicle Privacy Notice provides people with the most information about what its cars collect. This includes vehicle data, such as tire pressure, information about how parts are performing, and vehicle charging information if a vehicle is electric. The company also can collect driving data and characteristics, such as your speed, how you push the pedals, and seat-belt-related data. Information about your travel direction, precise location, speed, and local weather can be gathered from the vehicle. Voice recognition systems in some of its vehicles can gather information when they are listening. Its “media analytics” involves capturing information about what you listen to in your car, including “radio presets, volume, channels, media sources, title, artist, and genre.” The section of Ford’s privacy policy that is specific to California, which has stricter data laws than across the US, also provides extra data about what can be collected. “We utilize connected vehicle data to improve quality, minimize environmental impact, and make our vehicles safer and more enjoyable to drive and own,” Hall says. Chevrolet, which is owned by General Motors, collects both information about you and what you do with your vehicle, as all manufacturers we analyzed do. A company spokesperson says its privacy statement is the fullest documentation of what the company collects. This document also links to its specific privacy document for connected services, including its cars. We ran the Chevrolet Silverado through the privacy tool. As a starter, GM collects people’s identifiers, such as names, postal addresses, and email addresses. Chevrolet’s documents say it can collect information about your vehicle, such as its battery, ignition, and window data, gear status, and diagnostic information. It can also collect, among other things, your location, route history, your speed, and “braking and swerving/cornering events.” Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian The documents also say data “from camera images and sensor data, voice command information, stability control or anti-lock events, security/theft alerts, and infotainment (including radio and rear-seat infotainment) system and Wi-Fi data usage” can be collected. The company can also receive “information about your home energy usage,” which relates to the charging and discharging of electric vehicles. The Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Ram Pickup are two of the most popular vehicles in the US. Both the Jeep and Ram brands are owned by Stellantis, a firm that was created when Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and the Peugeot group merged in 2021. As a result, they largely use the same connected services privacy policy and terms of service, which can also cover Chrysler, Dodge, and Fiat. (Ram was a line of Dodge trucks until it became its own brand starting in 2010.) Stellantis can collect your name, address, phone number, email, Social Security number, and driving license number. The driving data the company collects, according to its documents, includes the dates and times you use it, your speed, acceleration and braking data, details of the trip (including location, weather, route taken), and, among other things, cruise control data. Like other manufacturers, it also collects data about the status of your car, including “refueling activity,” battery levels, images from cameras, and error codes that are generated. Your face and fingerprint data may be collected if you use services, such as digital keys, that need this kind of information to operate, the documents say. Privacy4Cars tool says the company is “silent” in its documents on whether data from synched phones is collected. Mark Silk, the head of software data analytics at Stellantis, says data is not collected from synched phones in vehicles, but the company does collect data from its “branded mobile remote apps.” Silk says that for the majority of its new vehicles, there are three ways for people to manage their personal data. “The ability to turn off and on the collection of geo-location data at any time from within the vehicle, the ability to opt-in/out and consent to specific uses of their personal data via our digital channels, and the ability to request the ‘right to be forgotten’ at any time—again this can be requested via digital channels,” Silk says, adding the company is rolling out more privacy tools in the future. 📧 Get the best stories from WIRED’s iconic archive in your inbox 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Boots Riley says a “gentler capitalism” won’t save society The last 96 hours of the Titan tragedy Deepfake porn reveals a “pervert’s dilemma” Video game remakes are in a golden age.

      "To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Eric Geller Small businesses and community nonprofits are often sitting ducks for hackers. But across the United States, programs are springing up to connect these vulnerable organizations with fresh-faced defenders: college students. Local businesses and other small organizations are facing an onslaught of cyberattacks, but federal agencies like the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are stretched too thin to help them all implement basic security measures. To fill this gap, public and private universities are launching cybersecurity centers modeled on law school legal clinics to train students as digital security consultants. In a country besieged by endless hacking campaigns that disproportionately burden small, under-resourced businesses, and with national agencies focused on more serious threats to critical infrastructure, university clinics could be the future of cyber defense at the local level. “There is a critical role for universities to play in community cyber defense,” says Sarah Powazek, the program director of public interest cybersecurity at the University of California, Berkeley's Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity. “Students are local, highly motivated, and able to provide a range of services pro bono for under-resourced organizations that otherwise couldn’t afford them.” In just a few months, the newest of these clinics will launch as a pilot project at the University of Texas at Austin, joining other schools that have formed a consortium to share ideas and lessons learned. But UT-Austin’s pilot program has a unique origin story. It was born out of conversations within CISA’s outside advisory board about an even more ambitious idea: a cyber 311 service offering emergency help to local businesses, modeled on the municipal hotlines that residents call to report potholes and broken street lights. Because sending college students to help companies recover from hacks raises a host of logistical and legal questions, UT-Austin’s clinic will first evaluate the simpler task of offering pre-attack guidance. But the program’s leaders say they’re still interested in the 311 concept that inspired the clinic—and if they can eventually make it work, it could help make colleges the cybersecurity backbones of their communities. The US faces twin cyber crises: Companies often lack the resources and knowledge to effectively protect themselves from hackers, and there are too few trained professionals to fill the cyber field’s many open jobs. Small- and medium-size businesses fall below a “cyber poverty line,” struggling to achieve even basic resilience. The persistent talent shortage—there are an estimated 756,000 vacant cyber positions in the US—only makes things worse. Enter the cyber clinic. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian For decades, law schools have used clinics to train future lawyers and support their communities with pro bono work. “There’s no learning like the learning that involves an actual, real client,” says Robert Chesney, the dean of UT-Austin’s law school, head of the university’s cybersecurity program, and founder of the new cyber clinic. “Everybody says those experiences are the most impactful things that they do.” In recent years, universities have begun using a similar model to tackle cyber threats. Schools in Alabama, California, Indiana, Massachusetts, and several other states now operate cyber clinics. The idea for the UT-Austin project emerged from discussions in CISA’s Cybersecurity Advisory Committee, a group of experts from the private sector, academia, civil society, and local government. During conversations about a university running a municipal cyber helpline, Austin quickly emerged as the ideal candidate, thanks to its already popular 311 service and the support of two committee members: Steve Adler, who was then Austin’s mayor, and Chesney, an influential UT faculty member. CISA director Jen Easterly has championed the project and recently told the advisory committee that her agency will consider launching a nationwide cyber 311 system after evaluating Austin’s new clinic and similar efforts. “The UT-Austin pilot is helping us better understand how we can provide cybersecurity services for small and medium-size businesses across our nation,” Easterly says in a statement, adding that she is “truly excited” about it. UT-Austin’s clinic will take the form of a two-semester course. In the fall, Francesca Lockhart, a former top Texas homeland security official Chesney recruited to lead the project, will teach students cybersecurity skills and partner them with local organizations and businesses, giving students time to learn how those organizations operate and what they need. In the spring, teams of students will then create and implement cybersecurity improvement plans for their clients. Lockhart’s curriculum will cover lessons like inventorying the devices on a network, scanning for and fixing known vulnerabilities, configuring a firewall, conducting penetration testing, and understanding the Linux operating system and the Python programming language, which are widely used in diagnosing and fixing security issues. The 20 people in the inaugural class include students majoring in business and computer science, but also those studying biochemistry and international relations. Lockhart is still evaluating a variety of potential clients, including small businesses; nonprofits serving vulnerable populations in Austin; neighboring school districts and city governments; and startups focused on fighting hunger, disease, and other social ills. Lockhart says the clinic represents “a great opportunity to get students real-world career experience and fill the cybersecurity workforce gap while also serving the needs of some of these under-resourced organizations.” Any expansion to a 311-type service is far off. “You need to walk before you run,” Chesney says. To Steve Adler, Austin’s former mayor, a cyber helpline would be a natural extension of the UT-Austin project. Austin’s 311 service already gets calls from people worried about phishing scams and other low-level cyberattacks. The next step would be to create a referral system so 311 operators could turn certain calls over to UT-Austin students trained to handle a wide range of common incidents. “It might expand the scope of what people think would be covered by a 311 call,” says Adler, who served as mayor from 2015 to 2023. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Another state is already forging ahead with this idea. Later this year, Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts will launch a security operations center (SOC) to answer emergency calls from the community. The 24/7 SOC, created in partnership with a state-funded consortium, will be staffed by professional cyber experts, but students will be able to observe and participate in their work. Chesney finds the 311 idea very appealing. “It’d be really great if we could get to that stage,” he says, in part because it would deepen ties between the school and the surrounding community, a constant priority for colleges. “It brings the town and the gown together,” Chesney says. “And it may end up being very central over time.” But many questions need to be answered first. What kinds of calls will the clinic be able to take? How will the increased call volume affect regular 311 operations? Will hacking victims even want to admit their problems and ask for help? Then there are the legal issues. Responding to a cyber crisis could expose students and faculty to liability. Universities are “incredibly risk-averse,” says UC Berkeley’s Powazek, and many resist offering even traditional clinic services, fearing that clients will sue if they’re later hacked. Before the clinic can evolve, Chesney and Lockhart have to launch it and see if it makes a difference. Measuring success won’t be easy. The clinic can track how many students it trains, how many organizations it helps, and how much it all costs. But whether its clients actually emerge more secure will be tricky to determine. Chesney says the clinic will conduct “satisfaction surveys” and stay in touch with clients over time to see if its advice sticks. It will also track alumni’s career paths to see if it’s moving the needle on the workforce issue. UT-Austin is already having “preliminary discussions” with other universities that want to launch similar clinics, according to Chesney. “All of this is meant to be replicated and copied and used elsewhere,” he says. Not every school will be able to launch a cyber helpline for their community, but Chesney thinks large universities like his should be able to do so. Whatever UT-Austin’s program ends up looking like, Chesney is clear about the ultimate goal: to “level up the difficulty, systematically across society, for the bad guys to get into the system.” “The sooner we can get everyone doing basic blocking and tackling,” he says, “the better off we’re all going to be.” Update 12:45 pm ET, June 7, 2023: Clarified Sarah Powazek's title at UC Berkeley. 📨 Understand AI advances with our Fast Forward newsletter 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Meet the psychedelic boom’s first responders Amazon’s new robots roll out an automation revolution ChatGPT’s storytelling chops are no match for D&D How Microsoft Excel tries to rebrand work as excitement Docs show FBI pressures cops to keep phone surveillance secrets 🔌 Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs Lily Hay Newman Dell Cameron Matt Burgess Andy Greenberg Andy Greenberg Matt Burgess Matt Burgess Dhruv Mehrotra More From WIRED Contact\n"

      "To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Dell Cameron A “must-pass” defense bill wending its way through the United States House of Representatives may be amended to abolish the government practice of buying information on Americans that the country’s highest court has said police need a warrant to seize. Though it’s far too early to assess the odds of the legislation surviving the coming months of debate, it’s currently one of the relatively few amendments to garner support from both Republican and Democratic members. Introduction of the amendment follows a report declassified by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence—the nation’s top spy—which last month revealed that intelligence and law enforcement agencies have been buying up data on Americans that the government’s own experts described as “the same type” of information the US Supreme Court in 2018 sought to shield against warrantless searches and seizures. A handful of House lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats alike, have declared support for the amendment submitted late last week by representatives Warren Davidson, a Republican from Ohio, and Sara Jacobs, a California Democrat. The bipartisan duo is seeking stronger warrant requirements for the surveillant data constantly accumulated by people’s cellphones. They argue that it shouldn’t matter whether a company is willing to accept payment from the government in lieu of a judge’s permission. “Warrantless mass surveillance infringes the Constitutionally protected right to privacy,” says Davidson. The amendment, he says, is aimed chiefly at preventing the government from “circumventing the Fourth Amendment” by purchasing “your location data, browsing history, or what you look at online.” A copy of the Davidson-Jacobs amendment reviewed by WIRED shows that the warrant requirements it aims to bolster focus specifically on people’s web browsing and internet search history, along with GPS coordinates and other location information derived primarily from cellphones. It further encapsulates “Fourth Amendment protected information” and would bar law enforcement agencies of all levels of jurisdiction from exchanging “anything of value” for information about people that would typically require a “warrant, court order, or subpoena under law.” The amendment contains an exception for anonymous information that it describes as “reasonably” immune to being de-anonymized; a legal term of art that would defer to a court’s analysis of a case’s more fluid technicalities. A judge might, for instance, find it unreasonable to assume a data set is well obscured based simply on the word of a data broker. The Federal Trade Commission’s Privacy and Identity Protection Division noted last year that claims that data is anonymized “are often deceptive,” adding that “significant research” reflects how trivial it often is to reidentify “anonymized data.” The amendment was introduced Friday to defense legislation that will ultimately authorize a range of policies and programs consuming much of the Pentagon’s nearly $890 billion budget next year. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which Congress is required to pass annually, is typically pieced together from hundreds, if not thousands, of amendments. This year negotiations are particularly contentious, given the split chamber and a mess of interparty strife, and only one in six NDAA amendments introduced so far have apparent bipartisan support. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Republican members Nancy Mace of South Carolina, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, and Ben Cline of Virginia have backed the Davidson-Jacobs amendment, according to the House Rules Committee website. They’re joined by Democrats Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Zoe Lofgren of California, and Veronica Escobar of Texas. Jacobs previously coauthored a related amendment with Davidson that attempted to compel the US military to disclose annually how often its various spy agencies purchase Americans’ smartphone and web-browsing data. The amendment was stripped from the final version of last year’s NDAA. The data broker report declassified last month by the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, stressed that neither presently, nor at any point in the past, would the government be permitted to force “billions of people to carry location-tracking devices on their persons at all times.” That is, nevertheless, what is happening today, independent of the government’s actions. The unceasing explosions of new technologies are clashing more and more frequently with the nation’s antiquated privacy laws, giving the Department of Homeland Security, Defense Intelligence Agency, and others like them an unmistakable loophole through which virtually anyone can be surveilled without a reason. Demand Progress senior policy counsel Sean Vitka, whose group has spent years lobbying for privacy reform in the face of the government’s growing and often secret reliance on data brokers, says the relatively untracked purchases—up to and including “turnkey lists of everyone who has gone to an abortion clinic, a place of worship, a rehab facility, or a protest”—represent an “existential threat” to the right to privacy. The Davidson-Jacobs amendment marks a “critical opportunity to get [federal lawmakers] on the record,” adds Vitka. The American Civil Liberties Union intends to score how lawmakers vote on the amendment, WIRED has learned. The lawmakers’ effort is also being supported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, FreedomWorks, and the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, among dozens of similar civil society organizations. Congressional staffers and others privy to ongoing conferencing over privacy matters on Capitol Hill say that regardless of whether the amendment succeeds, the focus on data brokers is just a prelude to a bigger fight coming this fall over the potential sunsetting of one of the spy community’s powerful tools, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the survivability of which is anything but assured. 📧 Get the best stories from WIRED’s iconic archive in your inbox 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Boots Riley says a “gentler capitalism” won’t save society The last 96 hours of the Titan tragedy Deepfake porn reveals a “pervert’s dilemma” Video game remakes are in a golden age.

      "To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Kate O'Flaherty Apple, Google, and Microsoft have released major patches this month to fix multiple security flaws already being used in attacks. May was also a critical month for enterprise software, with GitLab, SAP, and Cisco releasing fixes for multiple bugs in their products. Here’s everything you need to know about the security updates released in May. Apple has released its long-awaited point update iOS 16.5, addressing 39 issues, three of which are already being exploited in real-life attacks. The iOS upgrade patches vulnerabilities in the Kernel at the heart of the operating system and in WebKit, the engine that powers the Safari browser. The three already exploited flaws are among five fixed in WebKit—tracked as CVE-2023-32409, CVE-2023-28204, and CVE-2023-32373. CVE-2023-32409 is an issue that could allow an attacker to break out of the Web Content sandbox remotely, reported by Clément Lecigne of Google's Threat Analysis Group and Donncha Ó Cearbhaill of Amnesty International’s Security Lab. CVE-2023-28204 is a flaw that risks a user disclosing sensitive information. Finally, CVE-2023-32373 is a use-after-free bug that could enable arbitrary code execution. Earlier in the month, Apple released iOS 16.4.1 (a) and iPadOS 16.4.1 (a)—the iPhone maker’s first-ever Rapid Security Response update—fixing the latter two exploited WebKit vulnerabilities also patched in iOS 16.5. Apple iOS and iPadOS 16.5 were issued alongside iOS 15.7.6 and iPadOS 15.7.6 for older iPhones, as well as iTunes 12.12.9 for Windows, Safari 16.5, macOS Big Sur 11.7.7, macOS Ventura 13.4, and macOS Monterey 12.6.6. Apple also released its first security update for Beats and AirPods headphones. Microsoft’s mid-month Patch Tuesday fixed 40 security issues, two of which were zero-day flaws already being used in attacks. The first zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2023-29336, is an elevation-of-privilege bug in the Win32k driver that could allow an attacker to gain System privileges. The second serious flaw, CVE-2023-24932, is a Secure Boot security feature bypass issue that could allow a privileged attacker to execute code. “An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass Secure Boot,” Microsoft said, adding that the flaw is difficult to exploit: “Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to compromise admin credentials on the device.” The security update is not a full fix: It addresses the vulnerability by updating the Windows Boot Manager, which could cause issues, the company warned. Additional steps are required at this time to mitigate the vulnerability, Microsoft said, pointing to steps affected users can take to mitigate the issue. Google has released its latest Android security patches, fixing 40 flaws, including an already exploited Kernel vulnerability. The updates also include fixes for issues in the Android Framework, System, Kernel, MediaTek, Unisoc, and Qualcomm components. The most severe of these issues is a high-severity security vulnerability in the Framework component that could lead to local escalation of privilege, Google said, adding that user interaction is needed for exploitation. Previously linked to commercial spyware vendors, CVE-2023-0266 is a Kernel issue that could lead to local escalation of privilege. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian The May Android Security Bulletin is available for devices including Google’s own Pixel smartphones and tablets, as well as a number of devices in Samsung’s Galaxy series. Google has issued Chrome 113, which includes 15 patches for its popular browser. One of these fixed flaws is CVE-2023-2459, an inappropriate implementation bug in Prompts rated as having a medium severity. CVE-2023-2461 is a medium severity use-after-free issue in OS Inputs, and CVE-2023-2462, CVE-2023-2463, CVE-2023-2464, and CVE-2023-2465 are medium severity inappropriate implementation flaws. Google also fixed several inappropriate implementation Chrome vulnerabilities it rated as having low severity. Meanwhile, Google announced it is implementing a new quality rating system for security vulnerability reports. The system will rate reports as High, Medium, or Low quality based on the level of detail provided. “We believe that this new system will encourage researchers to provide more detailed reports, which will help us address reported issues more quickly and enable researchers to receive higher bounty rewards,” Google said, adding that the highest quality and most critical vulnerabilities are now eligible for rewards of up to $15,000. Open source DevOps platform GitLab has issued a security update to fix a major flaw. Tracked as CVE-2023-2825, the path traversal vulnerability could enable an unauthenticated malicious user to read arbitrary files on the server. Needless to say, the issue is serious—it has been given a CVSS score of 10. The update, 16.0.1 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE), is only required for installations running 16.0.0 and does not affect earlier versions. This is a critical severity issue, GitLab said in an advisory. “We strongly recommend that all installations running a version affected by the issues described are upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible.” Enterprise software giant Cisco has fixed multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based user interface of certain Cisco Small Business Series Switches that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause denial of service (DoS) or execute arbitrary code with root privileges. With a CVSS base score of 9.8, CVE-2023-20159 is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that could be exploited by sending a crafted request through the web-based user interface, Cisco said. Also with a CVSS base score of 9.8, CVE-2023-20160, CVE-2023-20161, and CVE-2023-20189 are unauthenticated stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, CVE-2023-20024, CVE-2023-20156, and CVE-2023-20157 are unauthenticated heap buffer overflow issues in the web-based user interface of Cisco Small Business Series Switches that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS). Software maker SAP has issued 25 new and updated security notes in its May 2023 Security Patch Day, including a fix for a flaw with a CVSS score of 9.8. CVE-2021-44152 is an issue in Reprise RLM 14.2 that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to change the password of any existing user. Meanwhile, CVE-2023-28762 covers information disclosure vulnerabilities in the SAP BusinessObjects Intelligence Platform. The newest and most critical one “allows an authenticated attacker with administrator privileges to get the login token of any logged-in BI user or server over the network without any user interaction,” security firm Onapsis said. 📩 Don’t miss our biggest stories, delivered to your inbox every day 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future The night 17 million military records went up in smoke The AI protest group campaigning against human extinction How your new car tracks you A grid collapse would make a heat wave far deadlier WIRED’s favorite “buy it for life” gear 🌲 Our Gear team has branched out with a new guide to the best sleeping pads and fresh picks for the best coolers and binoculars Andy Greenberg Matt Burgess Matt Burgess Kim Zetter Lily Hay Newman Tik Root Megan Greenwell Dell Cameron More From WIRED Contact\n"

David Nield The actual number of chat messages sent each day is hard to come by, but with WhatsApp alone accounting for billions of users, you can imagine the sheer volume of ongoing conversations. Not all of those messages involve anything particularly sensitive or private, but a lot of them do—and you don’t want those chats to be seen by anyone other than the intended recipients. Good messaging hygiene might involve changing apps or tweaking a setting, but it’s important that you don’t neglect it. These five recommendations can get you started. When instant messenger chats are end-to-end encrypted, they’re essentially turned into impenetrable blocks of data. Only the devices of the person (or people) you’re chatting with have the codes to unlock that data, which ensures no one else can read your messages while they’re in transit. Not even the developers behind the software you’re using can unlock that data, so if an unscrupulous employee wanted to take a peek at your chats, they wouldn’t be able to. If law enforcement requested copies of the conversations, there wouldn’t be anything useful to hand over to them. Some instant messengers use end-to-end encryption, but not all of them do. End-to-end encryption is deployed by default for Signal, WhatsApp (for personal chats,) iMessage, and Google Messages (with RCS enabled.) It’s also available as an option on Facebook Messenger and Telegram. If you’re using anything else, check the provider’s policies and consider switching to something more secure. Facebook Messenger lets you set messages to disappear. We mentioned that Facebook Messenger has the option of end-to-end encryption: To enable it, you need to make a conversation “secret” by tapping the info (“i”) button at the top of a chat in the mobile app, then choosing Go to secret conversation. Once you’re in that secret conversation, another feature becomes available: Disappearing messages. Tap the info button again and pick Disappearing messages, then choose how long messages should stick around after being read. This way of tidying up after yourself protects you against someone reading through your chats if they gain access to them or physical access to your device. Facebook Messenger isn’t the only app that offers this functionality: You can also find disappearing messages in WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram, among others. On iPhones, you can delete older conversations in the Messages app after choosing Messages and Keep Messages from Settings. To avoid an unwelcome visitor gaining access to your phone and all of your chats, one of the best things you can do is lock some or all of those chats behind a passcode or other lock—like the protection on your phone’s lock screen. WhatsApp makes this simple. You can lock the entire app via the Privacy menu in the app settings, or you can lock individual chats: Open the chat, tap the conversation name at the top of the screen, and then pick Chat lock. The options here will depend on the options on your phone (such as fingerprint lock and face recognition). Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Other apps offer the ability to lock all of your chats, including Signal, Facebook Messenger, and Telegram, though for the moment the option to lock individual conversations is exclusive to WhatsApp. Most instant messenger and social media apps let you control which other users are allowed to follow you, send friendship requests, communicate with you via direct messages, and so on. Tightening up these settings is another way to limit your exposure to the wider world and maximize the security of your chats. Take Telegram, for example. Head to Privacy and Security in Settings, and you can control who is allowed to see your online status, your profile photo, the groups and channels you’re in, and more. Other apps have similar options, so make sure you know what they are and what they do. Also, think about the temporary photo and video posts commonly known as stories if your app supports them (a lot now do). These stories have their own visibility settings and may well be public by default. Setting visibility options in Telegram. You want to keep backups of some conversations, otherwise you risk losing all of those records, and all that history, if something should happen to your smartphone. But it’s important to know what you’re backing up and where those backups live. Backups are another potential route for anyone trying to access your messages without authorization, so you should keep them as well protected and secure as anything that’s actually on your phone. Some apps back up your conversations locally, and few encrypt them, so make sure to check your favorite app’s settings. As a final precaution, you also need to think about other devices and locations where you’re logged in—Gmail can lead to Google Chat, for example—as well as places any external backups might be stored and how these are protected (take WhatsApp on Android, which can save chat backups to Google Drive). 📧 Get the best stories from WIRED’s iconic archive in your inbox 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Boots Riley says a “gentler capitalism” won’t save society The last 96 hours of the Titan tragedy Deepfake porn reveals a “pervert’s dilemma” Video game remakes are in a golden age.

By Lily Hay Newman and Dhruv Mehrotra Life After Roe How Google Profits From Anti-Choice Clinics The Lost Ob-Gyns The Abortion Pill’s Uncertain Future Europe’s Abortion Minefield The Underground Pill Market Now Reading TikTok Has an Information Stifling Problem If you search for the phrase “abortion pills” on the messaging service Telegram, an array of public channels and groups pop up. Some have names like “Buy Abortion Pills” or “Abortion pills Mifepristone Misoprostol” while others offer advice on symptoms and best practices “after the pregnancy comes out.” On May 3, a post on “ABORTION PILLS MARKET” included a photo of a blister pack labeled as abortion pills, alongside the caption, “We are legit.” There are currently more than 200 public groups and channels on Telegram that explicitly mention selling abortion pills in their name or description, a WIRED investigation found. At the end of May, the last month for which we have complete data, 57 of the 211 groups we uncovered were active, with at least one message sent in that month. Activity found on the platform related to selling abortion pills traces back to at least 2016, and many of the channels and groups cater to customers around the world. In the year since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, though, there’s a new focus on marketing to people in the United States, according to WIRED’s review of roughly 47,000 public messages scraped from these channels. And in general, public activity on Telegram related to abortion pills has been exploding since last summer. “Since its creation, Telegram has actively moderated harmful content including the sale of medications,” says Telegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn. “Telegram's moderators use a combination of proactive monitoring of public chats in addition to accepting user reports in order to remove content that breaches our terms of service.” Shady drug sellers and scams are nothing new on digital platforms. A nearly universal experience of the early consumer internet, after all, was receiving spam emails claiming to offer penis enlargement pills. And in the decades since, dark web markets have fueled illegal distribution of drugs globally. Like other prescription drugs, though, abortifacients are legal in some countries but not others. Furthermore, in some places they can be prescribed for certain purposes but not others, leaving patients to potentially seek ways to fill in the gaps for their own care. In the US, access to reproductive care, including abortifacients, varies widely from state to state. Despite the clear uptick in activity on Telegram related to abortion pills, researchers say that they don’t see evidence of a massive new movement to illegally sell abortifacients to Americans. Kat Green, an abortion access researcher and founder of the online data analysis platform Endora, says that illegal sales of abortifacients, and corresponding questions about legitimacy and safety, aren’t currently central topics in US abortion access work. In part, this is likely because it’s still legal in many US states for patients to get abortion pills by mail. And prescribed use of these pills, also known as medication abortion, is markedly on the rise in the US. But as new and pending legal challenges threaten to further curtail access, illicit sales could eventually expand. Analysis of frequently used phrases in the Telegram message trove WIRED collected shows that a large number of these groups and channels don’t just claim to sell abortion pills. Phrases like “weight loss,” “muscle mass,” and “erection pill” were among the 10 most popular two-word phrases that appeared in the data set. And thousands of additional messages mentioned “benzos,” “painkillers,” “Xanax,” “weed,” “coke,” and “guns.” In all, at least a quarter of the channels appear to be hawking more than just abortifacients. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Hundreds of messages from the data that contained pricing information indicate that the average cost of purchasing a purported pack of abortion pills on Telegram is currently $135. WIRED’s investigation also indicates that the abortion pill ecosystem on Telegram is likely a small world. Analysis of the members and administrators who send messages in the groups and channels shows that many of the accounts are likely controlled by the same individuals. For example, a user going by the name Dr. Pooja Gupta has sent 1,500 messages across nine channels or groups advertising the sale of abortion pills. Dr. Pooja uses a WhatsApp number that is referenced by administrators in 14 additional channels. And some of them use similar names like Doctor Jain and Doctor Reenu. Many of these messages also referenced the same website. After joining several of Dr. Pooja Gupta’s channels, WIRED reporters received a private Telegram message from a user known as Manisha Gupta offering medication abortion for $90. When WIRED reporters expressed interest in making a purchase, a person prepared the order and sent an image showing a blister pack of pills, and an envelope with that day's date as well as the address WIRED provided for shipment. The return address written on the envelope was a location in Mumbai, India. Still messaging on Telegram, a person then sent account information for Punjab National Bank and directed WIRED to submit payment through a service called Remitly. WIRED reporters did not complete the transaction. When asked whether they have had more US-based customers in recent months, the person said, “since new laws I am send to America much more.” Some groups on Telegram have US-specific names or descriptions, like “Abortion Pills in Republican States,” but most have more generic names and claim to deliver to dozens of countries. For instance, one of the largest and most active channels in the data set dates from August 2021 and is apparently specifically geared toward delivering abortion pills to Dubai, Kuwait, Qatar, and the Philippines—all countries where legal access to abortion is restricted. Last June, researchers from the security firm DarkOwl noticed a sharp increase in discussions on the dark web about connecting abortion-seekers in the US with abortifacients and other resources. Some vendors that already sold illegal drugs said they would begin selling medication abortion as well. At the time, though, the researchers said that they didn’t actually see abortion pills widely available for sale on most dark web markets, but that “they are available for purchase via threads in discussion forums, as well as classified-style advertisements on transient paste services.” Ian Gray, director of analysis and research at the security firm Flashpoint, says that turning points like the Covid-19 pandemic or the fall of Roe for the US can spark trends in digital scams and illicit online sales. But a survey Gray conducted for WIRED of dark web advertising targeted at the US over the last year did not reveal a dramatic spike in content related to abortifacients. “At a high level, it's difficult to identify a significant increase in chatter related to abortion pills due to Roe v Wade being overturned last year,” Gray says. He notes, though, that “there are a limited number of posts within the past year in marketplaces, which may indicate demand. Most posts, at least on Twitter and some within Telegram, are in Brazilian Portuguese, likely due to a ban on abortion pills.” As with many medical procedures, the stakes are extremely high in medication abortion. But the patchwork of laws and access in the US could make the landscape particularly fraught for patients in need who may eventually turn to illicit markets out of desperation.

If it checks out on the airline’s website, you’re good to go, right? Don’t be sure. Fraudsters are abusing a little-known but decades-old technicality in how airline reservations work to con people out of their cash. Mevonnie Ferguson, who lives in Kent in the UK, says she was scammed out of £994 ($1,267) by someone claiming to work at a travel agency called Infinity Global Travel. A single working mother of two daughters, Ferguson says she was sold what appeared to be a valid British Airways ticket from London to Kingston, Jamaica. When she looked up the reservation on BA’s website using the confirmation number and her last name, it showed up valid and fine. But about two weeks after purchasing this ticket from Infinity Global Travel, and just days before her scheduled departure date, the reservation disappeared from BA's website without a trace. Ferguson, who also relayed her story to the UK's Channel 5, contacted the airline and explained her situation, but she was told there were no flights booked in her name. BA would not release information to Ferguson, as she was not the party who had directly booked the reservation with the airline, she says. After some persuasion, the BA representative ultimately told Ferguson that while the reservation code she provided was correct, there was no record of an e-ticket number. Ferguson has since tried to get a refund from the supposed travel agent, who has neither returned her money nor responded to subsequent calls and emails. A BA spokesperson asked WIRED for additional details so they could investigate but did not otherwise respond to a request for comment. This problem isn’t unique to British Airways or any one airline in particular. In fact, it’s an intentional part of the air travel industry's reservation process that scammers can abuse. Like many travelers, Ferguson did not understand the difference between a “confirmed” and a “ticketed” reservation, travel industry jargon terms that are not synonymous. The system makes it possible to create what appears to be a valid flight reservation, but which is actually a mere temporary reservation “hold.” Here’s how the con works: A scammer entices customers with cheap airline tickets through email, a website, or social media. Once they have a victim's details, the scammer purchases a reservation hold—not the actual plane ticket—via a travel agency. They then pass that hold on to the victim as a legitimate ticket. The victim can check the airline’s website and see that the reservation is in the system. But once the two weeks are up the hold disappears, and the scammer makes off with the money the victim thought they were spending on a real—albeit suspiciously cheap—plane ticket. Most airlines will not let individual passengers hold a prolonged reservation directly. As an example, Qatar Airways lets anyone hold a flight for just 72 hours for a “minimum fee,” without paying the full fare up front. This means you’ll be provided a valid passenger name record (PNR) number, but your reservation will not be “ticketed”—meaning no e-ticket number—until the full fare is paid. By contrast, travel agencies have much more power and flexibility to hold a reservation, a weak point that gives scammers an in. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Some legitimate travel agencies will let you pay as little as $15 to $20 to “hold” a flight ticket for a couple of weeks. And there are good use cases for this. When applying for a tourist visa, for example, embassies or consulates of a destination country may ask applicants to provide proof of return travel. Rather than purchase a full ticket, applicants may instead opt to pay a travel agent a small fee and get a valid flight booking, with a real PNR that can be verified by the visa officer on an airline’s website. Should their visa application be refused for any reason, applicants lose only the small fee paid to the travel agent—a better deal than hassling with an airline to modify or cancel a full ticket or failing to get a refund entirely. Sites like Expedia and Skyscanner are, of course, the mainstream way people book air travel. But for anyone who needs a long hold, travel agencies are their only option. These agencies advertise inexpensive reservation holds as “flight itineraries for visa applications,” which are colloquially known as “dummy tickets” and are valid for two weeks. This time window is enough for a scammer to con someone. To test how a dummy ticket scam works, I purchased a Qatar Airways reservation for $20 via a legitimate third-party travel agency. For the two weeks after I made this booking, Qatar Airways’ website would show the confirmation number as valid. But no e-ticket number is listed anywhere on the reservation—indicative of this being a mere “hold”—meaning it's a reservation that’s “confirmed” but not ticketed. Scammers do exactly the same thing by booking the hold under their victim’s name. Scams aside, the gap between reservation holds and ticketing can cause problems for travelers all by itself. In 2019 a traveler named Alexander told his story to The Points Guy of a mishap in which his flight to Spain was merely confirmed but never ticketed—which he didn’t find out until he arrived at the airport. In this case the problem had to do with the airline’s policy of not issuing e-tickets against bookings until an identity check was completed by the passenger—something Alexander missed because the ID verification email landed in his spam folder. But the mechanism behind his and Ferguson’s scenarios are identical. Suffice it to say, it is best to book your flight tickets directly with an airline or via a trusted travel platform. If an offer sounds too good to be true, it may be a scam. And always verify with the airline if your “confirmed” reservation indeed has a real ticket to go along with it. 📨 Understand AI advances with our Fast Forward newsletter 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Meet the psychedelic boom’s first responders Amazon’s new robots roll out an automation revolution ChatGPT’s storytelling chops are no match for D&D How Microsoft Excel tries to rebrand work as excitement Docs show FBI pressures cops to keep phone surveillance secrets 🔌 Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs Kim Zetter Andy Greenberg Matt Burgess Matt Burgess Lily Hay Newman Tik Root Megan Greenwell Dell Cameron More From WIRED Contact\n",

Reece Rogers On May 16, Google announced new plans to delete accounts that have been inactive for two years, as well as accounts that were created and never used (or used only briefly). Got an ancient Gmail account gathering cobwebs or a Google Photos account storing vacation pics from years past? It’s time to start looking around for those login credentials. If you haven't signed in within the past two years, your account and everything it contains could be deleted starting as soon as December. This change impacts Google Calendar, Drive, Docs, Gmail, Meet, and Photos. Accounts with YouTube videos are a noteworthy exception from the new deletion policy, as are any accounts with active subscriptions (paying your bill counts as “activity”). Also, this change applies only to personal Google accounts, not profiles tied to companies or classrooms. (Hear that? It’s the collective sound of a thousand bosses and principals sighing in relief.) Worried about your personal Google account getting vaporized? Here’s how to make sure that your account is active, and a few quick tips in case you forgot your password. Stopping Google from deleting your account is straightforward, if you can remember the password. Just log in. That’s it! No further steps need to be taken. According to the Google blog post from Ruth Kricheli, vice president of product management, “if you have signed into your Google Account or any of our services recently, your account is considered active and will not be deleted.” OK, simple enough. There’s no need to log out and log back in to accounts you’re using just to be safe. This change is for accounts with no “activity.” What’s that mean to Google? Basically, anything you do with the account is considered activity, from doing a search with Google, to reading an email in Gmail, to accessing a document with Google Drive. The goal here is to improve Google’s overall security by removing abandoned accounts, which are less likely to have strong, unique passwords or have two-factor authentication set up, Kricheli writes. Whoops! Don’t give up yet. Maybe you forgot your password, but can you remember the username or phone number? Go here to begin the account recovery process for most Google accounts and here for Gmail. Still encountering issues accessing your inactive account? Check out this article for advice from Google’s account safety team about what could be going on with your profile and a few potential remedies. Before it’s deleted, Google says it will send messages to the account’s main email and the recovery address. Similarly, if you’re the caretaker of someone’s account who can’t access it, or who has passed away and you’d like it memorialized, Google suggests using Google Takeout to download the data for safekeeping, or setting up the Inactive Account Manager to provide access so the account can stay accessible. The first wave of deletions will wipe out accounts that were registered but subsequently unused. When will the second wave of inactive account deletions start? The exact day remains unclear, so it’s a good idea to try to log in before December rolls around. After the new policy goes into effect, want to keep old Google accounts around that you just use sparingly? Try setting a reminder on your calendar to log in and click around every so often. Better yet, consider storing the data on a physical drive.

Dhruv Mehrotra Andrew Couts A year ago today, the United States Supreme Court overturned the decades-old ruling in Roe v. Wade, wiping out the federal right to abortion care in the US. But as history has shown, abortions do not simply stop because laws change—they go underground, where it’s less safe for the people who seek them. One of those subterranean places is the messaging app Telegram, where the number of groups and channels offering sales of abortion pills like mifepristone has grown substantially over the past 12 months, a WIRED investigation found. Sellers using apparent pseudonyms offer the drugs for around $135, on average, but there’s no guarantee that the pills buyers receive are what they say they are. Even if you have no plans of patronizing a Telegram drug market, there’s no escaping the artificial intelligence boom. If the doomsayers are correct, society is about to be inundated with AI-fueled misinformation, deepfakes, and more. But psychologists say humanity is simply not mentally ready for this new era, and researchers have only begun to explore what it means for our brains to live in a “post-truth world.” Your new car isn’t just a car—it’s a smartphone on wheels. As vehicles have become increasingly computer-controlled, so too has the amount of data carmakers can collect about drivers. We dove into the most popular vehicles in the US to suss out exactly how much of your privacy you’re giving up when you sit behind the wheel. Of course, phones themselves aren’t any better for your privacy, especially when law enforcement gets involved. Documents recently obtained by the ACLU show the extent the FBI will go to to keep police from revealing details about cell-site simulators, which are used to surveil a target’s phone. Despite the fact that the existence of these devices, also known as “Stingrays,” has been public for years, the FBI requires cops to keep their use a secret, both from suspects and the courts. But that’s not all. Each week, we round up the stories we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. On Wednesday, Apple released patches for several zero-day vulnerabilities exploited in a sophisticated spyware campaign called Operation Triangulation. Russia previously attributed the campaign to the United States, claiming in a press release that thousands of Russian government officials have had their iPhones infected with the spyware. They also allege that Apple colluded with the United States in the operation. Apple denies having worked with any government to insert a backdoor into its products. The patches address a pair of serious vulnerabilities, CVE-2023-32434 and CVE-2023-32439. The flaws were first revealed by Russian anti-malware vendor Kaspersky, which was a target of the spyware. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to implant spyware onto iPhones effortlessly by sending an iMessage. The spyware was programmed to remove itself once it successfully infiltrated the device. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Apple says the patches fix a memory corruption that allowed an app to execute arbitrary code and a WebKit vulnerability that enabled malicious code execution through web content. The attacks have been seen only on devices running versions of iOS released before iOS 15.7, according to the company. Even if you’re an unlikely target for spyware, now’s a good time to update your iPhone. This week, an alarming investigation by NBC News found that Discord, a social media popular with gamers, has become a popular venue for child sexual exploitation. NBC News identified 35 cases over the past six years in which adults have faced charges of kidnapping, grooming, or sexual assault that were allegedly facilitated by Discord. Nearly half of these cases resulted in guilty pleas or verdicts, while many others are still under investigation. NBC News’ review of cases is likely a vast undercount, the report says, as these numbers represent only reported cases where charges were brought. Victims generally face significant challenges when it comes to reporting, investigations, and prosecution. Stephen Sauer, the director of the tip line at the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, told NBC News, “What we see is only the tip of the iceberg.” According to experts interviewed by NBC News, while online child exploitation is not exclusive to Discord, the platform's decentralized moderation system and its young user base have likely made it an appealing environment for those seeking to exploit children. The investigation comes as a Washington Post report found that thousands of AI-generated child sexual abuse images have been found on forums across the dark web. According to The Wall Street Journal, US officials have been monitoring the activities of employees working for Chinese telecom companies Huawei Technologies and ZTE at suspected spy facilities in Cuba. The news comes amid a push to restrict the use of Huawei and ZTE mobile infrastructure across the West. Earlier this month, the Journal reported that China has been operating a spy base in Cuba since at least 2019 and that the two countries jointly maintain four additional eavesdropping stations on the island. Officials from the Biden administration caution that these facilities could potentially intercept electronic signals from US military bases. According to representative Mike Gallagher, the chairman of the US House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, Huawei and ZTE have had regular business presence in Cuba while working to modernize the island’s internet infrastructure. In a letter Gallagher sent to director of national intelligence Avril Haines, which the Journal viewed, Gallagher wrote that any enhancement of China’s intelligence capabilities in Cuba “is likely” to be aided by Chinese telecommunications companies. In a statement, Huawei described the report as \"groundless accusations\" and emphasized its commitment to full compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the regions they operate. Similarly, ZTE dismissed the Journal's reporting as \"baseless.\" The recent Reddit protest over changes to its business that threaten third-party apps was messy enough without hackers getting involved. The ransomware gang BlackCat is threatening to release some 80 GB of data that the company says was stolen earlier this year through a “highly targeted” phishing attack. Reddit says it doesn’t believe the hackers stole user data like passwords, but BlackCat says the files contain “confidential” information. The group is demanding Reddit pay $4.5 million and cancel its plans to charge app developers exorbitant fees for access to its application programming interface, or API. Otherwise the group says, it will release the data ahead of the company’s planned IPO. 📨 Understand AI advances with our Fast Forward newsletter 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Meet the psychedelic boom’s first responders Amazon’s new robots roll out an automation revolution ChatGPT’s storytelling chops are no match for D&D How Microsoft Excel tries to rebrand work as excitement Docs show FBI pressures cops to keep phone surveillance secrets 🔌 Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs Lily Hay Newman Andy Greenberg Andy Greenberg Lily Hay Newman Lily Hay Newman Dell Cameron Tik Root Kate O'Flaherty More From WIRED Contact\n",

Matt Burgess The conditions inside the Fulton County Jail system are dire. Inmates at one of the jails in Atlanta, Georgia, are sleeping on the floor in plastic trays. Cell doors hang off hinges, footage from one local news report shows, and leaked water pools on the floor in some areas. Last September, one person was found dead and covered in bed bugs. The Fulton County Sheriff’s Office, which runs multiple jails around Atlanta and has been granted more funding to fix the problems, is also in the process of rolling out a new surveillance system that can track inmates to precise levels. Across the region’s jails, hundreds of sensors are being embedded into the walls. Using radio frequencies, these communicate with wristbands issued to inmates. The system, which was created by Georgia-based firm Talitrix, can track an inmate’s heartbeat, determine their location every 30 seconds, and create 3D images showing who comes into contact with whom. Documents WIRED obtained through a public record request, including a legal agreement, statements of work, and internal PowerPoint presentations, describe how the monitoring system operates and provide a glimpse into its inner workings. The Fulton County Sheriff’s Office and Talitrix claim the system can help make understaffed jails more efficient and increase overall safety, while monitoring heart rates can alert staff to an inmate’s potential health problems or suicide attempts. Critics, meanwhile, say monitoring technologies subject inmates to more surveillance and fail to address deeper issues with the criminal justice system. The Talitrix system is one of a number of electronic monitoring devices being deployed in the sprawling web of local jails in the United States—and it may be one of the most sophisticated. Some appear to focus on suicide risk, while others have used RFID chips that are manually scanned. As jails and prisons face staffing shortages, they’ve increasingly turned to automation to monitor and control people caught up in the system. At the same time, academic researchers have said inmates are “one of the best surveilled, data-fied and documented populations,” without a choice to opt out. Talitrix’s tracking system is made up of two parts: the physical infrastructure—sensors embedded in the jail and Fitbit-like wearables—and its software that allows corrections officers to monitor data being collected and receive alerts. Talitrix first started working with Fulton County Sheriff’s Office in September 2021, company documents show. The firm initially ran a trial of its system within one of the region’s jails while it was developing the technology, and it has been expanding its use since February of this year. In total, the documents show, 750 sensors (costing $350 each) are to be installed and 1,000 wristbands (at $130 each) provided. The sensors are being placed around the jail but not within cells, those involved say. Use of the software costs hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. The plan is for around 450 inmates to wear the wristbands as part of a deal at the region’s main Rice Street jail, says Justin Hawkins, CEO of Talitrix. This includes the psychiatric and acute medical wards. (Lt Col Jarrett Gorlin, from the Sheriff’s Office, confirms that the department has been trialing the wristbands and is planning to further roll out the technology, although a “timeline for the full deployment is yet to be determined.”) Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian The biometric wristbands are not unlike sports watches, but they have been developed specifically for use in jails and prisons. Hawkins says the wristbands, which don’t have screens or GPS, can track people’s heart rate—oxygen tracking is coming to a future version—and communicate with the sensors in the walls. Hawkins says “several different radio frequencies” have been combined with the company’s algorithm to create the system. Each band has a battery life of 30 days and a locking mechanism that inmates cannot undo, the CEO says. If a band is cut, it will alert prison staff within 15 seconds, he says. The documents say the system can track where inmates are, recording how long they spend in cells or in specific areas of the jail, such as visitation rooms. A statement of work between the company and the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office from January 2023 says the software should include the ability to “maintain spacing between designated inmates” and “create and archive inmate movement.” It also says the devices are not certified as medical products. Screenshots of a dashboard of Talitrix’s software, which is called Inside the Walls, show correction officers can see how many inmates are within each area of the jail at any time, names of inmates, their jail-cell numbers, and heart rate details—including the last recorded rate and a graph over time. It shows the number of hours an inmate has been in their cell, compared to outside of it. A tab within the software lists alerts that have issued for inmates when their heart rate has dropped or spiked. One option within the system is a 3D reconstruction of the jail facility, dubbed a “facility replay.” This shows where inmates, represented by generic human characters, are standing at a given time. Screenshots in a Powerpoint slide show inmates standing near each other. “I think it’s a terrifying leap forward in terms of using technology to manage the jail population,” says James Kilgore, a media fellow at nonprofit MediaJustice, who has written about electronic monitoring and spent six years incarcerated. “It’s just legitimizing gathering all kinds of biometric data on people that really had nothing to do with people being in jail,” says Kilgore, who reviewed the documents at WIRED’s request. “I just fear what can happen if all of a sudden, the Talitrix says that your heartbeat is going 140 beats per minute, when it isn’t,” Kilgore adds. “And what they’re going to do to you, in response to all that data that they used.” “The heart rate data is used as a predictor of a potential serious health issue,” says Gorlin from Fulton County Sheriff’s Office. “If the individual falls outside of the prescribed levels, then the facility personnel are alerted. Further, the heart rate is not used in any algorithm that would impact personal privacy.” Gorlin says the location and movement of inmates can help “ensure proper count” and could eventually be used for “alerting jail personnel of two individuals coming into proximity with each other where a violent act could be perpetuated.” Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Hawkins says the company’s software takes an average heart rate over an entire minute and uses “predictive analytics” to take into account what a person’s heart rate usually looks like. Both the CEO and Sheriff’s Office official say biometric and location data is “view-only” and that correctional officers are not allowed to edit or export information. “Data is not used or released beyond the application in any fashion, and the application does not integrate with any other state, local, federal, or private application for the purpose of data transmission,” a statement says. Nicol Turner Lee, director at the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, says the system suggests an “additional layer of surveillance” for those who are incarcerated and that it is crucial this comes with “appropriate privacy protections,” including rules around how collected information can be used. “It’s very important for law enforcement and correctional institutions to ensure the protection of the data being collected so that it’s not straying from its intended purposes,” says Turner Lee, who also reviewed the documents. Surveillance and monitoring are intrinsic to prisons and jails around the world. Anne Kaun, a media and communication studies professor at Södertörn University, Sweden, has written a book on technology and prisons and says institutions have been used as testing grounds for surveillance technologies before they are further rolled out. In Sweden during the 1950s, prisons were one of the first places CCTV was used, Kaun says. “There was no discussion about privacy issues at all,” Kaun says. This is being replicated, at least to some extent, Kaun says, with new technological developments. Recent years have seen an uptick in the use of monitoring technologies within criminal justice systems and immigration enforcement. Hong Kong officials have suggested using facial recognition and robot wardens within prisons to help deal with staff shortages, while GPS ankle monitors and tracking apps are increasingly being used to monitor those who are released. Face recognition smartwatches have been proposed for use in the UK, and Chinese prisons are using “emotion-tracking” technology. Many of the systems have been error-prone, are unproven, or produce inaccurate results for individuals with darker skin tones. “There’s been this constant iteration of these different monitoring systems,” says Pilar Weiss, the director of the Community Justice Exchange, an NGO that works to end criminalization and incarceration. Weiss says that across the sprawling, largely privatized US prison system, which involves more than 4,000 suppliers providing services, there is little standardization of the systems that are used within jails. There is likely to be an expansion of monitoring systems across the United States, Turner Less says, because technology can be seen as a quick fix. With the patchwork of state-level privacy laws in place, there is not likely to be the “guidance and guardrails” in place to protect people’s data, Turner Lee adds. “When it comes to those impacted by the criminal justice system and those who are sitting within prisons, there is an implicit assumption that their rights do not matter.” Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Hawkins, the Talitrix CEO, says his company is on the verge of signing up more facilities to use its tool and is talking with other state-level correction facilities. He says the ways inmates are treated across the country is not acceptable because there is an over-incarceration rate within the United States, failing infrastructure within prisons, corruption among some officials, and staffing shortages that impact how inmates are treated. “Getting folks out of jail faster, who are not a threat to society, is the best thing that I think the United States could do,” he says. Ultimately, Kilgore says, putting technology into a system isn’t likely to improve the quality of life within a prison. “We need human solutions,” he says, such as policy changes and programs that address issues with the justice system. “You can’t put this technology into a punitive system and have it be anything but punitive.” 📧 Get the best stories from WIRED’s iconic archive in your inbox 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Boots Riley says a “gentler capitalism” won’t save society The last 96 hours of the Titan tragedy Deepfake porn reveals a “pervert’s dilemma” Video game remakes are in a golden age.

Reece Rogers When Aparna Pappu, vice president and general manager of Google Workspace, spoke at Google I/O on May 10, she laid out a vision for artificial intelligence that helps users wade through their inbox. Pappu showed how generative AI can whisper summaries of long email threads in your ear, pull in relevant data from local files as you salsa together through unread messages, and dip you low to the ground as it suggests insertable text. Welcome to the inbox of the future. While the specifics of how it’ll arrive remain unclear, generative AI is poised to fundamentally alter how people communicate over email. A broader subset of AI, called machine learning, already performs a kind of safety dance long after you've logged off. “Machine learning has been a critical part of what we’ve used to secure Gmail,” Pappu tells WIRED. A few, errant clicks on a suspicious email can wreak havoc on your security, so how does machine learning help deflect phishing attacks? Neil Kumaran, a product lead at Google who focuses on security, explains that machine learning can look at the phrasing of incoming emails and compare it to past attacks. It can also flag unusual message patterns and sniff out any weirdness emanating from the metadata. Machine learning can do more than just flag dangerous messages as they pop up. Kumaran points out that it also can be used to track the people responsible for phishing attacks. He says, “At the time of account creation, we do evaluations. We try to figure out, ‘Does it look like this account is going to be used for malicious purposes?’” In the event of a successful phishing attack on your Google account, AI is involved with the recovery process as well. The company uses machine learning to help decide which login attempts are legit. “How do we extrapolate intelligence from user reports to identify attacks that we may not know about, or at least start to model the impact on our users?” asks Kumaran. The answer from Google, like the answer to many questions in 2023, is more AI. This instance of AI is not a flirty chatbot teasing you with long exchanges late into the night; it’s a burly bouncer kicking out the rabble-rousers with its algorithmic arms crossed. On the reverse side, what’s instigating even more phishing attacks on your email inbox? I’ll give you one guess. First letter “A,” last letter “I.” For years, security experts have warned about the potential for AI-generated phishing attacks to overwhelm your inbox. “It’s very, very hard to detect AI with the naked eye, either through the dialect or through the URL,” says Patrick Harr, CEO of SlashNext, a messaging security company. Just like when people use AI-generated images and videos to create fairly convincing deepfakes, attackers may use AI-generated text to personalize phishing attempts in a way that’s difficult for users to detect. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Multiple companies focused on email security are working on models and using machine-learning techniques in an effort to further protect your inbox. “We take the corpus of data that’s coming in and do what’s called supervised learning,” says Hatem Naguib, CEO of Barracuda Networks, an IT security firm. In supervised learning, someone adds labels to a portion of the email data. Which messages are likely to be safe? Which ones are suspicious? This data is extrapolated to help a company flag phishing attacks with machine learning. It's a valuable aspect of phishing detection, but attackers remain on the prowl for ways to circumvent protections. A persistent scam about a made-up Yeti Cooler giveaway evaded filters last year with an unexpected kind of HTML anchoring. Cybercriminals will remain intent on hacking your online accounts, especially your business email. Those who utilize generative AI may be able to better translate their phishing attacks into multiple languages, and chatbot-style applications can automate parts of the back-and-forth messages with potential victims. Despite all of the possible phishing attacks enabled by AI, Aparna Pappu remains optimistic about the continued development of better, more refined security protections. “You’ve lowered the cost of what it takes to potentially lure someone,” she says. “But, on the flip side, we’ve built up greater detection capabilities as a result of these technologies.” 📧 Get the best stories from WIRED’s iconic archive in your inbox 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Boots Riley says a “gentler capitalism” won’t save society The last 96 hours of the Titan tragedy Deepfake porn reveals a “pervert’s dilemma” Video game remakes are in a golden age.

      "To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Dell Cameron United States government records recently obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union show that state and local police authorities are continuing to trade silence for access to sophisticated phone-tracking technologies loaned out by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. To protect the secrets of the technology, documents show, police departments will routinely agree, if necessary, to drop charges against suspects who've been accused of violent crimes. The documents, handed over by the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act, include copies of nondisclosure agreements signed by police departments requesting access to portable devices known as cell-site simulators, otherwise known by the generic trademark “Stingray” after an early model developed by L3Harris Technologies. The FBI requires the NDAs to be signed before agreeing to aid police in tracking suspects using the devices. Stipulations in the contracts include withholding information about the devices, they're functionality, and deployment from defendants and their lawyers in the event the cases prove justiciable. Legal experts at the ACLU, Laura Moraff and Nathan Wessler, say the secrecy requirements interfere with the ability of defendants to challenge the legality of surveillance and keep judges in the dark as to how the cases before their court unfold. “We deserve to know when the government is using invasive surveillance technologies that sweep up information about suspects and bystanders alike,\" Moraff says. “The FBI needs to stop forcing law enforcement agencies to hide these practices.” The ACLU obtained the documents after filing a lawsuit in response to a news story published by Gizmodo in 2020. It described a decision at L3Harris to stop selling cell-site simulators directly to local police departments, and how other smaller companies were, in response, moving to fill the vacuum in the market. The key function of cell-site simulators is to masquerade as a cell tower in order to identify nearby networked devices. This hack works by weaponizing a power saving feature common to most mobile phones: always ensuring they're connected to the closest cell tower emanating the strongest radio signal. Once the “handshake” between the device and a phone begins, there are a variety of authentication protocols the device must overcome. Tricking modern phones into connecting with the simulator has grown increasingly complicated since the earliest versions of the device were strapped to planes and used to intercept communications on US battlefields. Cell-site simulators used by police today come with additional modes and equipment to target individual phones in an area and can be used narrow their locations to a single home or apartment. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Multiple variants of the device are known to exist and some are capable of launching attacks more sophisticated and invasive than others. Some allow operators to eavesdrop on calls, or will force devices to execute unauthenticated commands that disable encryption or downgrade the connection to a lower and less secure network. One command sent by a phone, for example, can cause nearby cell towers to reject the device, rendering it incapable of network use. Whether US government entities have ever employed some of these advanced features domestically is unknown. Certain models used by the federal government are known to come with software capable of intercepting communications; a mode in which the device executes a man-in-the-middle attack on an individual phone rather than be used to identify crowds of them. Manufacturers internationally have marketed newer simulators capable of being concealed on the body and have advertised its use for public events and demonstrations. It is widely assumed the most invasive features remain off-limits to local police departments. Hackers, meanwhile, have proven it's possible to assemble devices capable of these feats for under $1,000. Contract language obtained by the ACLU shows police are required to use any “reasonably available” means to restrict the device from doing anything more than “recording or decoding electronic or other impulse to the dialing, routing, addressing and signaling information utilized in the processing and transmitting of wire or electronic communications.” Other records show cell-site simulators are listed as defense articles on the United States Munitions List, meaning trade in the technology is ultimately regulated by the State Department. This designation is used by the FBI, however, in order to compel secrecy from state and local agencies requesting its aid, as unauthorized disclosures about defense technology is considered an arms control violation punishable by up to 20 years in prison and $1 million in fines. Due to their interference with domestic cellular networks, the use of the device for law enforcement purposes is authorized by the Federal Communications Commission. Since 2018's US v. Carpenter decision, in which the Supreme Court held that cellular data containing location data is shielded by the Fourth Amendment, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has required federal agencies to obtain warrants before activating cell-site simulators. This extends to police departments borrowing the technology from the FBI. The DOJ crafts the language used by police in these interactions with courts to control the amount of legal scrutiny that falls on the device. It does this by conflating cell-site simulators with decades-old police technologies like the “trap and trace” and “pen registers,” names for devices and programs capable of identifying incoming and outgoing calls, respectively, but which do not gather location data. When police use the devices to locate a suspect on the loose or gather evidence of a crime, they are generally required by the FBI not to disclose it in court. In some cases, this leads police to launder evidence using a technique known as parallel construction, whereby the method used to collect evidence is concealed by using a different method to collect the same information again after the fact. The practice is legally controversial, particularly when undisclosed in court, as it prevents evidentiary hearings from weighing the legality of actual police conduct. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Documents show police are advised to pursue “additional and independent investigative means and methods” to obtain evidence collected through use of a cell-site simulator, though suggestions provided by the FBI on how this could be accomplished were redacted by the bureau. The power of judges to toss evidence seized in contravention of a defendant’s rights is, the Supreme Court wrote in 1968, the only true defense Americans have against police misconduct. Without it, then-chief justice Earl Warren wrote, “the constitutional guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures would be a mere ‘form of words.’” Under the US system, Warren said, “evidentiary rulings provide the context in which the judicial process of inclusion and exclusion approves some conduct as comporting with constitutional guarantees and disapproves other actions by state agents.” Allowing police and prosecutors to authenticate their own evidence, he added, would inevitably make the courts party to “lawless invasions” of American's privacy. Withholding information from judges about the ways in which evidence is collected, therefore, may easily interfere with one of the court’s most sacred duties; forestalling at the same time any scrutiny as to the constitutionality of the state’s conduct. The FBI, meanwhile, argues that secrecy is necessary, as revealing information about such devices would enable criminals to “diminish or thwart law enforcement efforts.” Information about them is therefore designated “law enforcement sensitive” or “protected homeland security information,” terms that describe unclassified information the government deems “for official use only.” These designations generally prevent documents from being disclosed to the public and may be exempt from use in legal proceedings. The FBI employs a “jigsaw” or patchwork theory of disclosure, documents show, to keep even minor details about cell-site simulators hidden from the public. It argues that details, no matter how small, may, “like a jigsaw puzzle,” eventually combine to reveal critical information about the technology. Because the devices are used in counterterrorism cases and in a counterintelligence capacity, the FBI further argues that revealing information about cell-site simulators would have a “significant detrimental impact on the national security of the United States.” The idea of prosecutors dropping cases merely to protect word from spreading about the use of an already well-known device is particularly concerning due to the gravity of crimes typically involved in cases where police bother to deploy them. Documents obtained by the ACLU show, for example, that police requested technical assistance from the FBI in May 2020 during a manhunt for a gang-affiliated suspect wanted for multiple murders. “This is a serious crime and a good use of our assistance abilities,” an FBI official wrote in response to the request. Though redacted to protect the privacy of the individuals involved, the document indicates the suspect had recently attacked a female victim leaving her greatly injured. The arguments compelling all this secrecy is difficult to square with the reality that, in the year 2023, both innocent people and criminals alike are far from naïve about how much like a tracking device cell phones actually are. The controversy around “stingrays” is so old that the tactical advantage they once offered exclusively to military spies works far more efficiently today as a commercial capability. To wit, finding a phone is now a standard feature on nearly all phones. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Whether everyday people comprehend that their phones are constantly broadcasting their locations is a question best answered by the man who was caught stowing his phone in a potato chip bag so he could play golf instead of work—a trick so effective (or possibly unnecessary) that, in the end, it took an office snitch to bring him down. It’s hard to imagine the crime spree the man might’ve pulled off had he only applied this advanced telecommunications mastery toward some more felonious endeavor. While the golfer was hailed widely as a “MacGyver” in the press, the trick he used to deceive his employer was first popularized in the 1998 thriller Enemy of the State. Early in the film, Gene Hackman’s character grabs and stuffs Will Smith’s phone into a potato chip bag (screaming at him, meanwhile, that the NSA can “read the time off your fucking watch.”) The film is worth mentioning because cell phones were essentially new at the time—which is to say, the knowledge, or belief, that law enforcement can track people’s movements based on their cellphones entered the mainstream back when fewer than 25 percent of Americans owned one. A man buying his counter-surveillance from a snack machine to avoid work doesn't care how the trick works, though anybody who has ever lost a radio signal in a parking garage is equipped to solve that mystery. The FBI can track cell phones. Unscrupulous golfers know it. Bank robbers and terrorists are presumably also clued in on this now. And no amount of silence that police or prosecutors ever agree to is going to diminish that. 📨 Understand AI advances with our Fast Forward newsletter 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Meet the psychedelic boom’s first responders Amazon’s new robots roll out an automation revolution ChatGPT’s storytelling chops are no match for D&D How Microsoft Excel tries to rebrand work as excitement Docs show FBI pressures cops to keep phone surveillance secrets 🔌 Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs Dell Cameron Matt Burgess Dhruv Mehrotra Andy Greenberg Dell Cameron Lily Hay Newman Matt Burgess Andy Greenberg More From WIRED Contact\n"

And there's more. Each week, we round up the stories we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. On Tuesday, a 7-2 decision by the US Supreme Court reversed the conviction of a man who repeatedly threatened a stranger online. Justice Elena Kagan wrote in the majority opinion that First Amendment free speech protections require such cases to show that online harassers or cyberstalkers were aware that their digital abuse could be construed as threatening. Threats of violence are not protected by the First Amendment, but the court said prosecutors must show that a defendant “consciously disregarded a substantial risk that his communications would be viewed as threatening violence.” The offender in the case the court looked at, Billy Counterman of Colorado, had “moved to dismiss the charge on First Amendment grounds, arguing that his messages were not ‘true threats’ and therefore could not form the basis of a criminal prosecution.” Counterman had persistently and repeatedly messaged a local singer he didn't know on Facebook over two years, and when she would block him he made new accounts to continue messaging her. Victims of online harassment and digital rights advocates warned following the decision that it creates a dangerous precedent to empower cyberstalkers. “The Court just handed stalkers and harassers, including of politicians, journalists, climate scientists, doctors advocating for vaccines, you name it, a new weapon,” Soraya Chemaly, director of the Women’s Media Center Speech Project, told the Washington Post. A cyberattack caused a multiday outage this week of a Russian satellite communication system from Dozor-Teleport. The platform is broadly used, including by the Russian military. Ukrainian satellite communication infrastructure suffered a similar outage more than a year ago. Dozor’s parent company, Amtel Svyaz, also grappled with significant system outages this week. Multiple hackers claimed responsibility for the attacks, including some purporting to be hacktivists and others who said they were affiliated with the Russian private mercenary army Wagner Group. In addition to the outage, one of the entities claiming responsibility for the attack said it had stolen data from Dozor and published 700 files, including documents and images, to a leak site and Telegram. The invasive phone monitoring app LetMeSpy said on June 21 that it was itself hacked. Attackers stole names, messages, call logs, and location data collected by the service, the company said. LetMeSpy is a Polish Android app that's used around the world to monitor thousands of people. The company's notice said that “a security incident occurred involving obtaining unauthorized access to the data of website users​​.” Years after a Russian espionage campaign launched a devastating supply chain attack against software firm SolarWinds, the US Securities and Exchange Commission sent legal notices—known as “Wells notices”—to certain current and former Solarwinds employees. Such notices warn of potential securities law violations that could lead to civil enforcement action, but they rarely relate to cybersecurity incidents. Notably, one of the SolarWinds employees who received a notice is the company's current chief information security officer, Tim Brown, who was Solarwinds' head of security architecture at the time of the attack. Company CFO Barton Kalsu also received a notice. The situation is potentially significant as the US and other countries attempt to develop appropriate accountability mechanisms for high-ranking executives who preside over breaches and other security lapses. The fear among security professionals is often that individual penalties will simply discourage talented practitioners from taking top roles.

Tik Root This story was co-published with Grist, a nonprofit media organization covering climate, justice, and solutions. With his electric Kia EV6 running low on power, Sky Malcolm pulled into a bank of fast-chargers near Terre Haute, Indiana, to plug in. As his car powered up, he peeked at nearby chargers. One in particular stood out.Instead of the businesslike welcome screen displayed on the other Electrify America units, this one featured a picture of President Biden pointing his finger, with an “I did that!” caption. It was the same meme the president’s critics started slapping on gas pumps as prices soared last year, cloned 20 times across the screen. \"It was, unfortunately, not terribly surprising,” Malcolm says of the hack, which he stumbled upon last fall. Such shenanigans are increasingly common. At the beginning of the war in Ukraine, hackers tweaked charging stations along the Moscow–Saint Petersburg motorway in Russia to greet users with anti-Putin messages. Around the same time, cyber-vandals in England programmed public chargers to broadcast pornography. Just this year, the hosts of YouTube channel The Kilowatts tweeted a video showing it was possible to take control of an Electrify America station’s operating system. While such breaches have so far remained relatively innocuous, cybersecurity experts say the consequences would be far more severe at the hands of truly nefarious miscreants. As companies, governments, and consumers sprint to install more chargers, the risks could only grow.In recent years, security researchers and white-hat hackers have identified sprawling vulnerabilities in internet-connected home and public charging hardware that could expose customer data, compromise Wi-Fi networks, and, in a worst-case scenario, bring down power grids. Given the dangers, everyone from device manufacturers to the Biden administration is rushing to fortify these increasingly common machines and establish security standards. “This is a major problem,” says Jay Johnson, a cybersecurity researcher at Sandia National Laboratories. “It is potentially a very catastrophic situation for this country if we don't get this right.” Vulnerabilities in EV charger security aren’t hard to find. Johnson and his colleagues summarized known shortcomings in a paper published last fall in the journal Energies. They found everything from the possibility of hackers being able to track users to vulnerabilities that “may expose home and corporate [Wi-Fi] networks to a breach.” Another study, led by Concordia University and published last year in the journal Computers & Security, highlighted more than a dozen classes of “severe vulnerabilities,” including the ability to turn chargers on and off remotely, as well as deploy malware.When British security research firm Pen Test Partners spent 18 months analyzing seven popular EV charger models, it found five had critical flaws. For instance, it identified a software bug in the popular Chargepoint network that hackers could likely exploit to obtain sensitive user information (the team stopped digging before acquiring such data). A charger sold in the UK by Project EV allowed researchers to overwrite its firmware. Justin Pot Parker Hall Alex Christian Parker Hall Such cracks could conceivably permit hackers to access vehicle data or consumers’ credit card information, says Ken Munro, a cofounder of Pen Test Partners. But perhaps the most worrying weakness to him was that, as with the Concordia testing, his team discovered that many of the devices allowed hackers to stop or start charging at will. That could leave frustrated drivers without a full battery when they need one, but it’s the cumulative impacts that could be truly devastating. “It’s not about your charger, it’s about everyone’s charger at the same time,” he says. Many home users leave their cars connected to chargers even if they aren’t drawing power. They might, for example, plug in after work and schedule the vehicle to charge overnight when prices are lower. If a hacker were to switch thousands, or millions, of chargers on or off simultaneously, it could destabilize and even bring down entire electricity networks. “We’ve inadvertently created a weapon that nation-states can use against our power grid,” says Munro. The United States glimpsed what such an attack might look like in 2021 when hackers hijacked Colonial Pipeline and disrupted gasoline supplies nationwide. The attack ended once the company paid millions of dollars in ransom. Munro’s top recommendation for consumers is to not connect their home chargers to the internet, which should prevent the exploitation of most vulnerabilities. The bulk of safeguards, however, must come from manufacturers. “It's the responsibility of the companies offering these services to make sure they are secure,” says Jacob Hoffman-Andrews, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit. “To some degree, you have to trust the device you're plugging into.”Electrify America declined an interview request. With regard to the issues Malcolm and the Kilowatts documented, spokesperson Octavio Navarro wrote in an email that the incidents were isolated and the fixes were quickly deployed. In a statement, the company said, “Electrify America is constantly monitoring and reinforcing measures to protect ourselves and our customers and focusing on risk-mitigating station and network design.” Pen Test Partners wrote in its findings that companies were by and large responsive to fixing the vulnerabilities it identified, with ChargePoint and others plugging gaps in less than 24 hours (though one company created a new hole while trying to patch the old one). Project EV did not respond to Pen Test Partners but did eventually implement “strong authentication and authorization.” Experts, however, argue that it’s far past time for the industry to move beyond this whack-a-mole approach to cybersecurity. “Everybody knows this is an issue and lots of people are trying to figure out how to best solve it,” says Johnson, adding that he has seen progress. For example, many public charging stations have upgraded to more secure methods of transmitting data. But as for a coordinated set of standards, he says, “there's not much regulation out there.” There has been some movement toward changing that. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included some $7.5 billion to expand the electric vehicle charging network across the US, and the Biden administration has made cybersecurity part of that initiative. Last fall, the White House convened manufacturers and policymakers to discuss a path toward ensuring that increasingly vital electric vehicle charging hardware is properly protected.“Our critical infrastructure needs to meet a baseline level of security and resilience,” says Harry Krejsa, chief strategist at the White House Office of the National Cyber Director. He also argued that bolstering EV cybersecurity is as much about building trust as it is mitigating risk. Secure systems, he says, “give us the confidence in our next-generation digital foundations to aim higher than we possibly could have otherwise.” Justin Pot Parker Hall Alex Christian Parker Hall Earlier this year, the Federal Highway Administration finalized a rule requiring states to implement “appropriate” cybersecurity strategies for chargers funded under the infrastructure law. But Johnson says the regulation omits devices installed outside that expansion, not to mention the more than 100,000 units already in place nationwide. Plus, he says, states haven’t offered much detail about what they’ll do. “If you drill down into the state plans, you'll find that they are actually extremely light on cyber requirements,” he says. “The vast majority that I saw just say they will follow best practices.” Just what constitutes best practice remains ill-defined. Johnson and his colleagues at Sandia published recommendations for charger manufacturers, and he noted that the National Institute of Standards and Technology is developing a framework for fast-charging that could help shape future regulation. But, ultimately, he would like to see something akin to the 2022 Protecting and Transforming Cyber Health Care Act that’s geared toward electric vehicles. “Regulation is a way to drive the entire industry to improve their baseline security standards,” he says, pointing to recent laws in other countries as models or starting points for policymakers in the United States. Last year, for instance, the United Kingdom rolled out a host of requirements for EV chargers, such as enhanced encryption and authentication standards, tamper detection alerts, and randomized delay functionality. The latter means that a charger must be able to turn on and off with a random time delay of up to 10 minutes. That would mitigate the impact of all the chargers in an area coming online simultaneously after a power outage or hack. “You don’t get that spike, which is great,” says Munro. “It removes the threat from the power grid.” Johnson is optimistic that the industry is moving in the right direction, albeit more slowly than is ideal. “I can't imagine [stricter standards] won't happen. It's just taking a long time,” he says. And he certainly doesn’t want to spark undue alarm, but rather apply steady pressure for improvement. “It's scary stuff,” he says, “but it shouldn't be fear-mongering.” 📧 Get the best stories from WIRED’s iconic archive in your inbox 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Boots Riley says a “gentler capitalism” won’t save society The last 96 hours of the Titan tragedy Deepfake porn reveals a “pervert’s dilemma” Video game remakes are in a golden age.

Justin Ling On May 14, 2022, 18-year-old Payton Gendron sent out a link to a select group of online friends. It was an invite to a private Twitch stream, access to his running online diary, and an upload of his 180-page manifesto. Those who clicked the link saw Gendron sitting in his car, in the parking lot of the Tops supermarket in Buffalo, New York. They watched as he lifted his AR-15-style rifle, equipped with a high-capacity magazine, and opened fire. He killed 10 people in just six minutes. Even before police stopped the massacre and arrested Gendron, the link was being posted to the anonymous imageboard 4chan. On /pol/, the site’s “politically incorrect” board, people commented in real time on the mass shooting. “Why not shoot up the abortion rallys? What a faggot,” one user wrote. Another chimed in: “The kids manifesto is actually pretty good.” Dozens of people who missed the livestream demanded a recording. Others declared it a deep-state false flag operation. One poster, however, was imploring the site’s users to accept responsibility. “Why is this place so full of hate and anger?” they asked. “It's like a den of inequity [sic]. Why don't you people ever express love or compassion?” They uploaded a photo of Payton Gendron, and named the file “the 4chan killer.” “You made Payton Gentron [sic], a sociopathic mass murderer,” they wrote. 4chan’s moderators soon jumped in and banned the user's account, deleting their comment. The reason for the ban: “Complaining about 4chan.” The way in which 4chan is managed and moderated is of growing interest among US government officials. The US House of Representatives' January 6 committee subpoenaed 4chan over its role in facilitating the assault on the US Capitol, while investigators with the New York Attorney General’s Office ordered the company to turn over thousands of records to better understand its role in Gendron’s terrorist attack. WIRED obtained a number of internal 4chan documents through a public records request. Those documents show how 4chan’s team of moderators—janitors, in their own nomenclature—manage the site. Internal emails, chat logs, and moderation decisions reveal how the site’s janitors have helped shape it in their own image, using their moderation powers to engender 4chan’s particular brand of edgelord white supremacy. In particular, the documents show how the site’s moderators responded to a wave of attention as their website had, once more, been cited as an ideological driver for an act of mass murder. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian More than that, the documents lay bare the degree to which 4chan’s toxic influence is a design, not a bug. In his manifesto, Gendron credited 4chan with showing him “the truth”—that is, a deeply paranoid and racist belief that “the White race is dying out.” He selected the Tops supermarket specifically because it was in a predominantly Black neighborhood. 4chan, too, told him what to do about it. Years earlier, browsing the site, he had come across a video of 28-year-old Brenton Tarrant stalking through the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019, murdering 51 people. In launching the attack in Buffalo, Gendron was following in Tarrant’s footsteps. He even liberally plagiarized Tarrant’s manifesto. And he made regular use of 4chan’s insular, hateful lexicon of memes and in-jokes. While Gendron has pled guilty to murder, domestic terrorism, and hate crimes charges, and is awaiting trial on additional federal charges, the families of some of the victims have filed a lawsuit against a number of social media companies, including 4chan, Discord, Reddit, Snapchat, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon. They allege that Gendron’s radicalization was caused by an inability, or outright refusal, by these companies to stem the flow of violent conspiracy theories online. Many of the companies named, however, do make a concerted effort to remove extremist content. But 4chan is markedly different. Its rules and moderation practices entrench its politics and culture in a major way. What is and isn’t allowed on the imageboard helps explain how it has become a website where racial slurs are used like commas, and where users frequently counsel each other to die by suicide and take as many people with them as they can. Its rules are simultaneously more onerous and more permissive than other social media sites. 4chan has 17 “Global Rules.” The first forbids any content that violates US law. “Any sort of threat of violence or terroristic acts would violate Global Rule #1,” the 4chan administrators wrote to the New York attorney general. Another rule, technically, bans racism—except on /b/, 4chan’s “random” board. There, racism is both allowed and encouraged. 4chan leadership confessed to the New York Attorney General’s Office that they take a permissive attitude towards racism on the /pol/ board as well. It is a similar approach to how 4chan handles “My Little Pony” content. (“All pony/brony threads, images, Flashes, and avatars belong on /mlp/,” the rules read.) The site’s Global Rules are augmented by hundreds of other board-specific rules. In practice, however, 4chan users know that the application of these rules is often arbitrary and that much depends on the moderator enforcing them. The janitors are free to deem just about anything “off-topic,” or to just make up their own rules as they go. According to 4chan’s filings to the New York Attorney General’s Office, the website regularly issues between 5,000 and 7,000 bans per day. That doesn’t include post deletions that do not result in an IP address ban. The website’s paid administrators submitted over 500 ban records to the state of New York, all of which touched—at least tangentially—on Gendron’s massacre in Buffalo. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Roughly 60 percent of those bans were because posts were off-topic, or on the wrong board. One person, for example, was banned for posting in /k/, the weapons board used by Gendron to pick his gear and prepare for his attack, to ask, “At what point do you people acknowledge we need some sort of restrictions or controls in this country?” The board’s rules state that “All images and discussion should pertain to firearms, military vehicles, knives, realistic mil-sim games, and other weapons.” (/k/ has just one board-specific rule: “All weaponry is welcome.”) According to the cross-section of bans provided to New York, which were issued in the days after the Buffalo mass shooting, 21 bans were imposed for violating US law. Some of those were, as 4chan pointed out to the Attorney General’s Office, for counseling for further terror attacks. The posts encouraged fellow 4chan users to kill politicians, journalists, law enforcement officials, Jewish and Black people, and to target Pride events. In practice, however, the majority of calls for violence on 4chan do not result in bans. Users frequently make calls to instigate a race war—a “boogaloo,” in far-right parlance—or make threats against individuals or whole classes of people. Their vitriol is particularly vile when it comes to Black, queer, and Jewish people. Users counsel each other to “go full ER”—a reference to Elliot Rodger, who, aged 22, murdered six people at his university in Isla Vista, California, in 2014 before dying by suicide. That kind of encouragement has been reflected back to 4chan by those who follow through on acts of violence. When 25-year-old Alek Minassian rammed a van through a crowd of people in Toronto, Canada, in 2018, killing 11 and injuring 15, some critically, he uploaded a post to Facebook immediately beforehand, making a convoluted reference to “Sgt 4chan” and the “Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger!” Mike Chitwood, the sheriff of Florida’s Volusia County, has gone out of his way to underscore just how prevalent these violent threats are on 4chan. His office has arrested multiple 4chan users for issuing specific threats against the sheriff himself. Users, undeterred and without reprimand from moderators, have responded with posts like: “Kill Sheriff Shitwood.” “Behead Sheriff Shitwood.” “Roundhouse kick Sheriff Shitwood into the concrete.” One particularly conspiratorial and racist poster, who sported a Nazi flag icon, was more blunt than many of their fellow users about 4chan’s toxic impact: “Hoping some kid reads this.. kinda keeps it in the back of his mind.. then if all things and chances fall in place then those kids may start a boogaloo in the future.” 4chan wasn’t always a hotbed of racial animus and hatred. When its founder, Chris Poole, ran the site, he was locked in a constant effort to keep it from sliding into racist chaos. Right until he quit the site in 2015, Poole actively resisted its emerging political streak. Initially, the imageboard trended towards a progressive libertarianism epitomized by the hacktivist group Anonymous. With time, however, it developed a harder edge. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian At one point, 4chan had been organizing raids on the notorious neo-Nazi forum Stormfront. But around 2010, Poole was reckoning with the fact that some of the boards on his website had essentially “become Stormfront,” as Dale Beran writes in It Came From Something Awful. In 2011, Poole created /pol/ explicitly to contain this growing far-right attitude, hoping it would spread no further. It didn’t work. “Rather, 4chan’s new neo-Nazi section thrived,” Beran writes. Poole would keep trying, in vain, to stem the growing vitriol. In 2014, the anti-feminist Gamergate movement took hold on 4chan. Poole tried to ban all discussions of Gamergate, but the reactionary ethos of the movement seeped into the website just the same. Soon after, Poole lost his stomach for the fight. In 2015 he sold the site to Hiroyuki Nishimura, a Japanese internet tycoon and founder of 2channel, on which 4chan is based. Nishimura, backed by millions of dollars in investment from Japanese toy company Good Smile, became the sole owner of 4chan. But his involvement has been largely hands-off. To help manage, moderate, and cultivate the imageboard, he enlisted the help of one of its most senior janitors: RapeApe. The senior moderator, sometimes referred to as “GrapeApe,” has exercised an enormous influence on 4chan over the past decade. As one former moderator told Motherboard in 2020, “RapeApe has an agenda: He wants /pol/ to have an influence on the rest of the site and [its] politics.” Documents turned over to New York investigators reveal that 4chan signed an agreement to pay RapeApe $3,000 a month for their services in 2015. By May 2022, that fee had risen to $4,400 a month. (RapeApe is one of very few 4chan staff who receive a salary.) Tasked with compiling these records for the New York attorney general, Nishimura offered them some overtime. “Could you add $1000 with an invoice for next month?” Nishimura wrote to RapeApe in 2022. “New York Attorney General paper works takes so much [of] your time. Thank you so much for you work!” After the Buffalo terrorist attack, one user posted a link to the Motherboard story to multiple sections of 4chan and laid the carnage at RapeApe’s feet. “I’ve been saying for years that rapeape’s /pol/tardation would result in severe consequences, and the mass shooting in Buffalo has proven me right,” they wrote. “Therefore, the only possible way to save this website is to have him doxxed, hunted down, and murdered.” The user was banned for violating US law. In the hour after Gendron’s attack, 4chan’s moderators congregated in a chat room. “Apparently today's mass shooter makes 4chan responsible in his manifesto,” one janitor, Astria, wrote. “4chan being associated with such an atrocity is the last thing I wanted.” The moderators hoped it was fake. “You couldn’t do a better job at making 4chan look bad.” Another janitor, Troid, wondered why they should bother discussing the mass murder. “What's the point of even mentioning it? unless we plan to do something about it, which we don't.” Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian “Be easy on him troid, its his first 4chan mass shooter as a mod ;^),” wrote a third janitor, yournamehere. Janitor Aeolian jumped in to insist it wasn’t their fault. “IMO this guy is an 8chan user, not really a 4chan user. I also think we do a really good job moderating potential threats. I don’t feel we’re lacking anywhere on the site in that regard.” In his manifesto, however, Gendron credits 4chan with his radicalization. While he credits 8chan as well, Gendron heaps praise on /pol/ and /k/, the guns board, for showing him the “truth” and helping him maximize his chances of carnage. “I got a lot of information from Plateland; a discord I found on 4chan’s /k/ board (love you guys),” Gendron wrote. Troid wasn’t as quick to dismiss 4chan’s role. “There are in fact threads about the great replacement on /pol/,” they wrote. “Let's not pretend we don't know what the connection is and why people would question 4chan in this instance.” The other janitors—whose display names in the chat do not necessarily correspond to their 4chan usernames—agreed. But in the ensuing hours and days, the conversation in the chat room drifted away from self-reflection. The moderators shifted blame onto other websites (“If he was on 4chan he wasn’t ‘from’ here.”), mocked federal agencies trying to investigate the litany of threats posted to the website (“We get tons of emails about each moron who makes one of those troll posts”), and lauded their own moderation efforts. In the chat room, set up to help janitors discuss their moderation practices, a junior janitor asked if requesting or sharing the video of the massacre violated the rules. “It’s prolly fine,” replied CIAeolian, a more senior moderator. (It’s unclear from the documents whether Aeolian and CIAeolian are the same person.) The debate turned toward which channel was the best placed to host recordings of the livestream. CIAeolian replied later with a clarification on 4chan’s first rule. Violating US law, they said, is “serious” and comes with “a long ban duration.” So it should be reserved for the most obvious violations, they added. ”E.g. ‘I’m going to commit a crime at date, time, place, location’ or ‘How do I acquire [illegal thing]?’” Nearly a week after the Buffalo terrorist attack, RapeApe and dsw—two moderators on 4chan’s payroll—had a conversation about the fallout. They had just received notice from their advertising platform, Bid.Glass, that 4chan was being dropped. “We just got a termination notice from Bid.Glass. I'm going to try to talk him out of it (it's basically one dude running the company), but in the likely event that fails we are going to need some kind of replacement,” RapeApe wrote. They continued: “So far neither the FBI nor the local police have any evidence that the shooter posted on 4chan at all.” RapeApe lamented that 4chan was “getting the shaft” as other websites, like Reddit and Discord, were being let off “scot free.” Reddit, however, aggressively moderates communities known to be advocating racism and violence—and it has outright banned a litany of far-right and incel communities. In his diary, Gendron wrote, “Many subreddits I joined have been banned.” Discord, meanwhile, took a number of steps to improve moderation in the wake of the Buffalo shooting, including banning the community where Gendron got tactical advice and partnering with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism. While it remains to be seen how effective those kinds of tactics are, Reddit and Discord can claim they are taking some action. 4chan, meanwhile, seems determined to change as little as possible, even if it could mean more acts of domestic terrorism carried out by its users. “This will never change unfortunately,” dsw wrote. “Unless we do soemthing [sic] drastic like removing pol and all other random boards,” they wrote. RapeApe dismissed the suggestion less than 20 seconds later. “Even if we do none of these companies are going to accept us.” “They might, if 4chan rebrands itself,” dsw replied. But RapeApe wasn’t swayed. “That’s naive.” 📨 Understand AI advances with our Fast Forward newsletter 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Meet the psychedelic boom’s first responders Amazon’s new robots roll out an automation revolution ChatGPT’s storytelling chops are no match for D&D How Microsoft Excel tries to rebrand work as excitement Docs show FBI pressures cops to keep phone surveillance secrets 🔌 Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs Lily Hay Newman Dell Cameron Matt Burgess Dhruv Mehrotra Matt Burgess Eric Geller Dhruv Mehrotra Lily Hay Newman More From WIRED Contact\n"

Reece Rogers Yes, two-factor authentication is a crucial layer of security to add to your online accounts, but you remain vulnerable to hacks if you receive the codes via text message. A better way to manage these quick codes is to use an authenticator app, like Google Authenticator or Twilio Authy. When you use an authenticator app, the multifactor codes are available in-app instead of through a text. Want to make the switch from a 2FA process ruled by SMS messages to a more secure option? Here’s how you can get started with Google Authenticator, what’s recently changed about the app, and how to access your codes in-app. To start off, download the app to your smartphone or tablet. Google Authenticator is available for iOS and Android. Open the app and tap on the Get Started button. You will have the option to either log in with your Google account or use the app without logging in. If you do log in, Google Authenticator will save your 2FA data for you. More on this in a moment. The next step is to pick which online account you want to set up with Google Authenticator. The websites you visit most often likely support multifactor authentication through the app. From Amazon and Gmail to TikTok and Dropbox, the steps vary a little, but the overall process is essentially the same. Once you’ve selected an account, the rest of the setup can go one of two ways. You can either scan a QR code using the camera on your smartphone or manually enter the code. Let’s use Amazon’s login process as an example. Your first option is to log in to your Amazon account on a laptop, go to the Account page, and choose Login & security. Then, click Turn on for two-factor authentication and Get started on the following page. The preselected choice you’ll see is to receive the codes via text message. Instead, choose the option for an Authenticator App. When you see a QR code on the laptop screen, open the Google Authenticator app on your phone. Tap the plus sign in the bottom-right corner of the app and then Scan a QR code. Decide whether you want to allow the app access to your camera; otherwise you’ll need to enter the codes by hand. Scan the barcode with your smartphone and an expiring code will pop up in the app and keep regenerating. Next, type the six-digit code into the laptop. Acknowledge that older devices may require a special login process for 2FA codes and finish the setup process. In the past, a common criticism of Google Authenticator was that all of your codes were locked into one phone. If you lost the device on a buzzy night out with friends or a thief snatched it from your grasp, it could be difficult or impossible to get into your connected accounts. Similarly, if you upgraded your phone, it could be a pain to scan all of the QR codes for your sites and services or to export and import them to the new device and set everything up again. In addition to some design changes, Google recently added functionality that enables your codes to be synced across your Google account. When you’re in the authenticator app, you’ll see a green cloud with a check mark in the top-right corner next to your profile photo that indicates your codes are synced. Note that you have to be logged in to use this feature, so if you’ve been using Google Authenticator without logging in, you’ll have to either log in to store the info in your account or export and import your data on new devices the old way. So, you’ve set it up and synced the codes with your Google account. What’s next? When logging in to any accounts you’ve connected to Google Authenticator, you’ll open the app, locate the impermanent code associated with that account, and use it to finish the process. Looking for more ways to protect your online accounts? An authenticator app is not your only option for beefed-up security. In fact, you can protect your most important logins even further with a physical security key.

Matt Burgess There aren’t many websites bigger than Pornhub. Each month, more than 2 billion people visit the adult site, spending an average of almost eight minutes browsing and watching videos—an eternity in internet time. All that activity has the potential to generate huge volumes of data. Now Pornhub is facing a series of legal challenges across Europe over the information it collects. Activists and researchers are filing a complaint today against Pornhub in Italy that claims the company is “illegally” handling the data of millions of people. The complaint—which is based on a technical analysis of the website and its privacy practices and builds upon previously unreported complaints in the country and in Cyprus, where Pornhub is legally based in Europe—alleges that the company falls foul of Europe’s strict GDPR rules, which govern how people’s data can and should be used. Pornhub doesn’t allow people to easily opt out of being tracked by cookies; the site isn’t clear about the data it shares with third parties; and its algorithm “assigns” people sexual preferences, based on the videos they watch, says Alessandro Polidoro, a digital rights activist and the lead attorney of the litigation. Polidoro is representing #StopDataPorn, a collective that includes researchers and civil liberties organizations involved in the action. Polidoro spoke with WIRED about the legal complaints but did not disclose the text, due to the privacy of individuals involved. The legal complaints, which could take years to resolve, arrive as the online adult industry faces increased scrutiny from regulators around the world, with governments blocking what is accessible online and demanding that people show ID to access adult material. Polidoro claims that the group found “a lot” of potential issues with the way Pornhub uses people’s data but has decided to focus on three areas. First, there’s the issue of people giving consent to be tracked, Polidoro says. Under Europe’s privacy laws, if a website wants to track someone, it has to obtain consent. That’s why the web is littered with annoying cookie popups. Open YouTube, for instance: In Europe, a big popup appears stating how cookies are used, and it gives people the option to accept, reject, or customize them. However, if you open Pornhub, a banner appears at the bottom of the page that says the website uses cookies. It includes an option to find out more information and a button that says “OK,” but it provides no way to stop cookies from tracking you. (The banner does not appear in the UK or US, according to tests by WIRED.) Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian “Pornhub is not asking for consent,” says Polidoro. “Pornhub is dealing with the sexual preferences of users, and they don’t ask for consent.” Polidoro says cookies are deployed whether someone clicks “OK” or doesn’t click the button. The second element of the GDPR problems, Polidoro says, has to do with the way Pornhub shares the information it collects with other businesses owned by its parent company, MindGeek, which is based in Canada and was recently purchased by private equity firm Ethical Capital Partners. The group claims there is little transparency around what data is shared and how it is used. The final element of the complaints claims that Pornhub uses people’s data and “unilaterally assigns sexual preferences to each individual without their knowledge,” according to statements from the group behind the action. Polidoro claims that someone only needs to watch a small number of videos to be shown more of that kind of content. Freely available tools that monitor what trackers websites use, such as Blacklight and Privacy Badger, show that Pornhub data is transmitted to Google via its analytics platform and tag manager, and also TrafficJunky, the advertising platform owned by MindGeek. TraffickJunky claims its ads are viewed 3.2 billion times a day. One tracking technology Pornhub uses is capable of storing IDs of the videos you watch—using the “watchedVideoStorage” and “watchedVideoIds” keys—on your computer or phone, WIRED tests found. Each time you watch a video, even if you aren’t logged in to Pornhub, an ID number for it is added to a list in your browser’s local storage. “They basically create a parallel search history kept directly on the user’s device,” Polidoro says. A MindGeek spokesperson says the company does not comment on ongoing litigation and will respond \"through the appropriate process in time.\" \"MindGeek is committed to protecting user privacy, and is continuously implementing measures to safeguard the personal data of everyone in its community,\" the spokesperson says. Pornhub's privacy policy, which details the data it can collect about people, says it uses cookies for multiple purposes. For example, it uses cookies to help people log in, to “personalize and enhance” people’s online experience, to record how many people are using its website, and to track the pages people visit and serve ads. “You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent,” the privacy policy says. It also says Pornhub has turned on Google Analytics IP anonymization so full IP addresses are not stored. Emily van der Nagel, a lecturer in social media at Monash University, Australia, who researches social media identities, says that while Pornhub’s privacy policy does include what data it collects and uses, it is “probably unlikely” that the average user looks at this information. “If data collection appears to be happening on a technical level, from an opaque organization, with no insight into the social consequences, users are unlikely to attempt to intervene in the data collection,” Nagel says. “If there is a threat of social harm, for example, porn preferences surfacing as targeted ads that display prominently on a work computer—this is when users become aware of what data porn websites collect about them and seek to intervene in that data collection and use.” Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian While one new GDPR complaint is being filed in Italy today, the #StopDataPorn group also filed broader complaints with officials in Italy and Cyprus last year. Italy’s data regulator refused WIRED’s request to comment on the issues. Irene Loizidou Nicolaidou, the commissioner of Cyprus’s data protection regulator, says they cannot comment as there is a “pending audit” of Pornhub and the case is ongoing. Much of the underlying research for the complaints was completed by Tracking Exposed, a digital rights group that has developed a custom browser extension to analyze Pornhub’s personalization algorithm. The group published a peer-reviewed analysis of Pornhub’s algorithm in May 2022. The complaints are likely to draw attention to the amount of data the pornography websites collect and how they handle that information. Generally speaking, porn companies can collect huge reams of data about who visits them. In 2019, researchers analyzed 22,484 porn websites and found that 93 percent of them leak data to third parties, 44.97 percent “expose or suggest” a gender or sexual identity that is likely to be linked to the user, and 79 percent used tracking cookies from outside companies. Google’s trackers were on the vast majority of websites, the research found. “Since Pornhub is modeled on YouTube, it isn’t a surprise that data practices characteristic, or foundational, to social media are also present,” says Susanna Paasonen, a professor of media studies at the University of Turku, Finland, who researches sexuality and pornography. “The degree to which this is obvious to casual users is, however, impossible to predict.” Paasonen points to the fact that Pornhub has in recent years highlighted how much data it can collect through its Insights series, which details traffic trends on the website and provides some transparency. “But as there are no opt-outs—as required by GDPR—and I doubt how many users read their privacy policy that makes the tracking pretty obvious, the transparency vis-à-vis users is questionable,” Paasonen says. For most people, using privacy browsers or privacy-enhancing browser extensions can help limit what data is collected and how they’re tracked.

Matt Laslo AI is defining the future, even as many US senators struggle to understand it in the present. “It would have been better if it had been held in a room where the acoustics were better,” Senator Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, says of a much-anticipated—if overdue—All-Senators AI briefing orchestrated by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer earlier this month. The shoddy acoustics of the first of three closed-door meetings—kept private to insulate senators from electoral pressure to perform before cameras—were far from Grassley’s biggest complaint. “I would say that the next [one] will be more valuable, because this was a very general overview,” he says. As AI expands its foothold across industries, households, and legislative bodies—including amongst some at the Capitol itself—Congress is under pressure to act quickly, even though many lawmakers still don’t know what they’re being asked to regulate. While Schumer, the White House, and industry leaders are spotlighting the revolutionary power of artificial intelligence, it’s still unclear if this hyper-dysfunctional Congress—currently consumed by the 2024 election cycle—can address AI before it remakes our world in its generative image. For now, AI seems to be the least partisan issue in Washington, even as today’s bipartisan optimism is coupled with bicameral fear. This otherwise divided Congress is tuned in to AI—from Nafta flashbacks as some imagine AI upending today’s already upended job market to persistent Cold War fears now trained on AI’s potential to launch nuclear strikes. And that’s to say nothing of the electoral threat posed by generative AI and increasingly sophisticated deepfakes. These dauntingly high stakes may explain the Senate’s collective shrug after Schumer’s first big, closed-door AI reveal. “There wasn’t much there that I hadn’t heard, and that’s a pretty low bar,” says Senator John Hickenlooper, a Colorado Democrat. “I wish it was more substantive.” Senators inside the room when the doors closed say Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Antonio Torralba was informative, especially when answering basic—yet seismic—questions, like how does AI learn? While the briefings are secret, earlier this week Schumer delivered a highly publicized AI address in which he laid out his shiny new SAFE Innovation Framework for AI Policy at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian “In many ways, we’re starting from scratch, but I believe Congress is up to the challenge,” Schumer told the crowd. “AI moves so quickly and changes at near-exponential speed, and there’s such little legislative history on this issue, so a new process is called for.” As a once-distant future rapidly becomes our present, the overarching question is: Can the current Congress learn fast enough to adapt? For what is likely this briefest of windows, many US senators are gathering before a vetted few AI intellectuals, unified by their earnest search for answers. The thing is, some of those answers may not exist, even as humanity—and the Senate—journeys into the algorithmic unknown. Over the Silicon Valley tech boom of the past two decades, Congress has held many hearings—some less embarrassing than others—but when it comes to actual regulations, lawmakers have been mostly hands-off. Schumer is now vowing to do what he and his colleagues have failed to do thus far: regulate the tech titans who have spent tens of millions of dollars all but painting the Senate in their trademarked hues. That pressure is yet another reason the doors are closed for these All-Senators AI briefings. “I think it’s nonpartisan. The partisan elements within our parties don’t have a reason yet for this to become partisan, and I think we need to think through and come up with good policy before that happens, because then it’ll get infinitely harder to get something done,” Senator Martin Heinrich, a Democrat from New Mexico, says of regulating AI. He’s braced for potential legislative land mines from the tech lobby. “I’m sure they’re coming.” Besides Heinrich, Schumer’s helping orchestrate these private AI tutorials with Senate Republicans Todd Young of Indiana and Mike Rounds of South Dakota. The group’s goal is lofty, to collectively educate the Senate while empowering lawmakers to tackle the minutiae of what may be the most complex technology humans have ever encountered. While Hickenlooper was frustrated by the lack of substance at the first briefing, others are more patient with colleagues who are “at different spots along the learning curve,” says Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia. “I think there were a lot of senators where it was needed because a lot of the senators in that room were where I was nine months ago,” says Warner, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee. “It takes a number of these sessions before you kind of get it.” The four senators at the heart of this AI lecture series understand criticisms of the first one. It was “kinda an AI 101,” Rounds says. The bipartisan group of senators has already vetted the next speaker—who I can only assume is scheduled to outline scenarios of war, peace, and global domination—after the Senate’s two-week July 4 recess. “The next one with regard to what we’re doing offensively and defensively within the Department of Defense is really the one that’s going to wake people up and let them see how critical it is that we continue to allow AI to be enhanced in the United States,” Rounds says. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian In contrast to Congress’ battle with TikTok and its Chinese-owned parent company, ByteDance, lawmakers aren’t exempting Silicon Valley firms from their AI inquiries. But when it comes to the military, Rounds and the others fear the AI rush among America’s adversaries, something they plan to highlight for their colleagues in the next briefing, which won’t be open to the public. “This is really important to get this one as well-attended as possible,” Rounds says. “The speaker that’s going to be laying this out, we’ve already had a report from him. It’s a great educational opportunity. It’s one that I’m really trying to get as many members of my conference to come to as possible because the speaker does a very good job of laying it out in some detail.” While Schumer outlined a sprawling blueprint of his goals, Rounds and the others say they’re as much on a listening tour as they are tour managers for this summer’s AI lecture circuit. “What the idea is, is to get these ideas out so people can vet them,” Rounds says. “I’m encouraging people to bring their ideas in, and every committee should have the opportunity to look at what’s critical to their committee. This is just a great way to allow for all of those to kind of find a central location where we can work our way through a lot of them.” Even with some senators still catching up on the basics of AI, Schumer and his bipartisan allies were overall happy with their first all-senators meeting. “Listen, if you’re delivering a lecture to scores of senators, they’ll be at varying degrees of expertise, so I actually think it was appropriate for the audience,” Senator Young of Indiana says. Young has worked with Schumer before, and they hope their past success portends good things here. In 2019, Young and Schumer began negotiating the Endless Frontier Act, which was focused on increasing US competitiveness against China. It evolved into the US Innovation & Competition Act. Then it became America Competes Act, and finally the CHIP Act–and even the CHIPS+ Act—before President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law last year. While negotiations started with Young and Schumer, they didn’t end there. Rather, the pair heard input from other congressional committees and worked that into the final package. “That was the most utilization I’ve seen of the committee process since I’ve been in Congress, and I think this has an opportunity to be even more inclusive,” Young says. “Senator Schumer and I started off with legislation, but then we drew extensively from different committees of jurisdiction. I think that this effort will be even more decentralized.” While many senators will introduce their own AI measures, Young says the bipartisan effort is aimed at getting lawmakers on the same page. “So some of us may have bills, but the real point of emphasis here will be on crowding in ideas from others, so I think this will be more committee-focused,” Young says. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Schumer’s Democratic partner in the AI talks is Heinrich, the New Mexico Democrat, who says the closed-door meetings in the Senate are meant to help strengthen the Senate’s long-standing committees. “I think where we are right now is encouraging everyone through the normal processes,” Heinrich says. “Different committees are going to have very different jurisdictions.” And there are a lot of committees and many AI-related issues to tackle. For example, the Judiciary Committee will need to sort out copyright questions, the Armed Services Committee will handle questions of war, peace, and nuclear Armageddon (concerns Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, has raised). And the Education Committee will handle AI’s potential impact on public education. Lawmakers—and their staffs—also have to pore over today’s laws to see which work and which need a reboot, like copyright law in the AI era. “Some of that, the existing law is adequate, and in other places, it’s not,” Heinrich says. For now, the AI talks have largely remained above the partisan fray. Last week, a bipartisan and bicameral group unveiled a new proposal to erect a national AI commission—comprising 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans—to address AI in a more dispassionate manner than we’ve come to expect from Congress. Even so, pro-industry critics are starting to voice their concerns over what they see as a rush to regulate. “Putting the federal government in charge of the granular development of AI is a strategy certain to ensure that China beats us in every respect in the development of AI—and that would be catastrophic,” says Senator Ted Cruz. Cruz is the top Republican on the Senate’s Commerce, Science & Transportation Committee, which has sweeping jurisdiction over the economy. The junior senator from Texas fears Congress is going to overstep and crush innovation in the name of digital protectionism. “I think that’s foolhardy. Very few members of Congress have any idea what AI is, much less how to regulate it. There are—no doubt, there are risks and risks we need to take seriously, but there are also enormous potential productivity gains. And the last thing we want to do is turn technology innovation into the Department of Motor Vehicles,” Cruz says. Like his 99 colleagues, Cruz will get his say in due time. While the bipartisan AI working group isn’t focused on producing a massive, catch-all AI bill, its members know that such legislation could be the final outcome, following on the heels of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. If that happens, it will be legislation the likes of which the Senate has never seen, in part because AI appears to be all-encompassing. “It’s going to be big. It’s going to be big, and our hope is that all of the relevant committees do the hard work of figuring out where those things are,” Heinrich says. “Hopefully, we can get on the same page on a number of those things and then package that together.” 📨 Understand AI advances with our Fast Forward newsletter 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Meet the psychedelic boom’s first responders Amazon’s new robots roll out an automation revolution ChatGPT’s storytelling chops are no match for D&D How Microsoft Excel tries to rebrand work as excitement Docs show FBI pressures cops to keep phone surveillance secrets 🔌 Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs Tik Root Megan Greenwell Dell Cameron Dhruv Mehrotra Matt Burgess Matt Burgess Lily Hay Newman Matt Laslo More From WIRED Contact\n"

Andy Greenberg From TikTok to Huawei routers to DJI drones, rising tensions between China and the US have made Americans—and the US government—increasingly wary of Chinese-owned technologies. But thanks to the complexity of the hardware supply chain, encryption chips sold by the subsidiary of a company specifically flagged in warnings from the US Department of Commerce for its ties to the Chinese military have found their way into the storage hardware of military and intelligence networks across the West. In July of 2021, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security added the Hangzhou, China-based encryption chip manufacturer Hualan Microelectronics, also known as Sage Microelectronics, to its so-called “Entity List,” a vaguely named trade restrictions list that highlights companies “acting contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States.” Specifically, the bureau noted that Hualan had been added to the list for “acquiring and ... attempting to acquire US-origin items in support of military modernization for [China's] People's Liberation Army.” Yet nearly two years later, Hualan—and in particular its subsidiary known as Initio, a company originally headquartered in Taiwan that it acquired in 2016—still supplies encryption microcontroller chips to Western manufacturers of encrypted hard drives, including several that list as customers on their websites Western governments' aerospace, military, and intelligence agencies: NASA, NATO, and the US and UK militaries. Federal procurement records show that US government agencies from the Federal Aviation Administration to the Drug Enforcement Administration to the US Navy have bought encrypted hard drives that use the chips, too. The disconnect between the Commerce Department’s warnings and Western government customers means that chips sold by Hualan’s subsidiary have ended up deep inside sensitive Western information networks, perhaps due to the ambiguity of their Initio branding and its Taiwanese origin prior to 2016. The chip vendor’s Chinese ownership has raised fears among security researchers and China-focused national security analysts that they could have a hidden backdoor that would allow China’s government to stealthily decrypt Western agencies’ secrets. And while no such backdoor has been found, security researchers warn that if one did exist, it would be virtually impossible to detect it. “If a company is on the Entity List with a specific warning like this one, it’s because the US government says this company is actively supporting another country’s military development,” says Dakota Cary, a China-focused research fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington, DC-based think tank. “It's saying you should not be purchasing from them, not just because the money you’re spending is going to a company that will use those proceeds in the furtherance of another country’s military objectives, but because you can’t trust the product.” Technically, the Entity List is an “export control” list, says Emily Weinstein, a researcher at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. That means US organizations are forbidden from exporting components to companies on the list, rather than importing components from them. But Cary, Weinstein, and the Commerce Department note that it's often used as a de facto warning to US customers not to buy from a listed foreign company, either. Both networking firm Huawei and drone-maker DJI have been added to the list, for instance, for their alleged ties to the Chinese military. “It’s used somewhat as a blacklist,” says Weinstein. “The Entity List should be a red or maybe a yellow alert to anyone in the US government who’s working with this company to take a second look at this.” Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian When WIRED reached out to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, a spokesperson responded that the BIS is restricted by law from commenting to the press on specific companies and that a company's unlisted subsidiary—like Initio—isn't technically affected by the Entity List's legal restrictions. But the spokesperson added that “as a general matter, affiliation with an Entity Listed party should be considered a ‘red flag.’” Hualan didn't respond to WIRED's multiple requests for comment, but Initio spokesperson Mike Ching responded in a statement that Initio primarily makes controller chips for consumer storage products, and that its \"current products are developed by Initio itself.\" He added that \"Initio is not able to set any backdoors to their products.\" Hualan's Initio chips are used in encrypted storage devices as so-called bridge controllers, sitting between the USB connection in a storage device and memory chips or a magnetic disk to encrypt and decrypt data on a USB thumbdrive or external hard drive. Security researchers' teardowns have shown that storage device manufacturers including Lenovo, Western Digital, Verbatim, and Zalman have all at times used encryption chips sold by Initio. But three lesser-known hard drive manufacturers, in particular, also integrate the Initio chips and list Western government, military, and intelligence agencies as customers. The Middlesex, UK-based hard drive maker iStorage lists on its website customers including NATO and the UK Ministry of Defence. South Pasadena, California-based SecureDrive lists as customers the US Army and NASA. And US federal procurement records show that Poway, California-based Apricorn has sold its encrypted storage products to NASA, the Navy, the FAA, and the DEA, among many others. The encryption features enabled by Initio chips in those drives are designed to protect their data against compromise if the drives are physically accessed, lost, or stolen. But the security of that encryption feature essentially depends on trusting the chip's designer, cryptography experts warn. If there were a secret vulnerability or intentional backdoor in the chips, it would allow anyone who lays hands on any drives that use them—the drives are often marketed for use “in the field”—to defeat that feature. And that backdoor could be very, very difficult to detect, cryptographers note, even on the closest inspection. “In the end, it's a matter of trust, whether you actually trust this vendor and its components with all your sensitive data,” says Matthias Deeg, a security researcher at German cybersecurity firm Syss, who has analyzed the Initio chips. “These kinds of microcontrollers are a black box to me and every other researcher trying to understand how this device is working.” Last year, Deeg analyzed the first firmware of a Verbatim secure USB thumbdrive that uses an Initio chip and found multiple security vulnerabilities: One allowed him to quickly bypass a fingerprint reader or PIN on the drives and access any “administrative” password that had been set for the drives, a master password feature designed to allow IT administrators to decrypt users' devices. Another flaw allowed him to “brute-force” the decryption key for the drives, deriving the key to access their contents in at most 36 hours. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Deeg says that Initio has since fixed those vulnerabilities. But more troubling, he says, was how tough it was to do that analysis of the devices' firmware. The code had no public documentation, and Hualan didn't respond to his requests for more information. Deeg says the lack of transparency points to how difficult it would be to find a hardware-based backdoor in the chips, such as a minuscule component hidden in their physical design to allow for surreptitious decryption. He notes, too, that there's no way of knowing whether the vulnerabilities he found were accidental. “Is it better to have a hidden backdoor,” Deeg asks, “or one that is more visible but can be attributed to negligence by the developer?” When WIRED reached out to device manufacturers who use Initio chips, iStorage, the UK-based encrypted hard drive maker, told WIRED that its storage devices' architecture means that users don't have to trust Hualan or its Initio subsidiary because the private keys used to encrypt and decrypt data stored on them are generated and stored by a separate chip that comes from a different, France-based manufacturer, and the Initio chip never stores that key. “I appreciate concerns with using Chinese technology, but we’re very confident that even though we’re using these chips, our products cannot be hacked, even by Initio or Hualan,” iStorage's CEO John Michael says. (Michael also noted that some of iStorage products use a chip sold by Taiwanese firm Phison instead of Hualan or Initio, but didn't specify which products.) Even if a bridge controller chip doesn't create a secret key and isn't intended to store it, however, it still has enough access to it to enable a backdoor, says Matthew Green, a cryptography-focused computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University. After all, a bridge controller performs the encryption and decryption using that secret key, and so could either secretly exfiltrate and store it or furtively encrypt the data with its own, different key. “If the chip has the key and does the encryption, there is a possibility of malfeasance,” Green says. iStorage also passed on a statement from Initio pointing out that Initio isn't specifically named on Commerce's Entity List, and arguing that Hualan's inclusion on the list doesn't apply to Initio. But the Atlantic Council's Cary argues—echoing the Commerce spokesperson's “red flag” comment to WIRED—that wholly owned subsidiaries of companies on the list are generally considered to effectively be on the list, too. “I don’t buy that line of argument,” Cary says of Initio's claim to not be affected by the Entity List, pointing out that otherwise the list's restrictions could be easily circumvented through the use of subsidiary companies. “If the company that owns you is on the Entity List, you’re included.” WIRED also reached out to Hualan and Initio customers including NATO, NASA, the US Navy and Army, the DEA, and the FAA. Of those that responded, none would comment on what hardware they buy. But statements from NATO, the US Navy, and the UK Ministry of Defence all repeated that they carefully vet the security of the technology they use. “We have policies in place to address supply chain risk management, as well as established security standards to ensure all procured commercial products and services are inspected for security vulnerabilities,” read a statement from the US Navy, for instance. An FAA spokesperson said the agency complies with government regulations like the National Defense Authorization Act related to the purchase of hardware, but didn't answer questions about purchasing components from companies on Commerce's Entity List. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian In fact, several of the encrypted hard drives that use Hualan's and Initio's chips tout that they do have cybersecurity certification from the National Institute of Standards and Technology such as the FIPS 140-2 standard. But Johns Hopkins' Green notes that for that level of certification, NIST generally only checks for accidental vulnerabilities in cryptographic products, not intentionally hidden ones created by a determined adversary. “These backdoors can be so subtle and clever, and there’s so many ways to do them that you may not even see in the code,” Green says. “It would really shock me if any of these tests are assuming an untrusted manufacturer.” The mere fact that so many Western government agencies are buying products that include chips sold by the subsidiary of a company on the Commerce Department's trade restrictions list points to the complexities of navigating the computing hardware supply chain, says the Atlantic Council's Cary. “At minimum, it's a real oversight. Organizations that should be prioritizing this level of security are apparently not able to do so, or are making mistakes that have allowed for these products to get into their environments,” he says. “It seems very significant. And it’s probably not a one-off mistake.” Update 9 am ET, June 15, 2023: Added additional comment from an Initio spokesperson.

Andy Greenberg Andrew Couts Prison surveillance is now much more than skin deep. A jail in Atlanta, Georgia, has begun rolling out a new tracking system that monitors everything from inmates’ locations to their literal heartbeats, according to documents WIRED obtained through a public records request. Made by Talitrix, the system uses hundreds of sensors installed around a jail that link to a Fitbit-like wristband worn by inmates. Georgia prison officials say the surveillance tech will improve safety inside and help mitigate the impacts of staffing shortages. Privacy experts say it’s the latest erosion of inmates’ rights. If privacy is virtually nonexistent in jail, it may not be much better before you’re even convicted of a crime. Just ask a family in Indiana’s Monroe County, who are being monitored by probation officers through an app called Covenant Eyes. The app records everything a person does on their device, taking screenshots at least once per minute as well as monitoring network requests, all of which are sent to an “ally.” (The allies, in this case, are two probation officers.) The father, who has been charged with possession of child sexual abuse material, is in jail awaiting trial after the app alerted officers that someone had attempted to visit Pornhub, which would have been a violation of his bond. But thanks to shortcomings in the app, the whole thing may have been a mistake. Beyond potentially unconstitutional surveillance, there are many other ways government data collection can hurt your privacy. Millions of people in India may have had their data exposed thanks to an alleged breach of CoWIN, India’s vaccination-tracking app. The Indian health ministry says reports of a breach are “without any basis,” and independent security researchers say the breach may not be as widespread as some believed. The government is now investigating. In the US, a newly declassified report commissioned by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence reveals that spy agencies have been compiling a “large” trove of data about virtually every American simply by purchasing the information from commercial sources, like data brokers. Privacy advocates say the practice is a potential end run around constitutional protections. Earlier this month, a former intelligence officer publicly claimed the US government has an “intact” craft made by a “non-human” entity, among other extraterrestrial allegations. The claims have caught the attention US Congress members, several of whom are planning investigations. Given the openness some lawmakers have to conspiratorial thinking, this issue may finally fly out of the shadows. A more pressing concern for the US government may come from right here on Earth. Encryption chips made by a subsidiary of a company on the US Commerce Department’s so-called Entity List are being used by a slew of government bodies, including the US Navy, NATO, and NASA. The company, Hualan, landed on the Entity List thanks to its close ties to China’s military. But this “red flag” hasn’t stopped these agencies and others from purchasing the encryption chips from Initio, a Hualan subsidiary, raising concerns over a potential backdoor. Initio says it doesn’t have the ability to implement a backdoor in its chips, and several agencies told WIRED that they take the necessary precautions to ensure the security of the tech they use. Given how difficult it is to find a backdoor in these chips, however, these assurances may do little to assuage experts’ fears. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Finally, the Russia-based ransomware gang Clop went on a hacking spree that hit US government agencies and international companies including Shell and British Airways. Clop hackers carried out their cybercriminal campaign by exploiting a vulnerability in the file-transfer service MOVEit. The flaw has since been patched, but the full extent of the stolen data and list of targets remains unclear. But that's not all. Each week, we round up the biggest security and privacy stories we weren't able to cover in depth ourselves. Click on the headlines to read the full stories, and stay safe out there. As Russia has carried out its unprecedented cyberwar in Ukraine over nearly a decade, its GRU military intelligence hackers have taken center stage. The notorious GRU hacker groups Sandworm and APT28 have triggered blackouts, launched countless destructive cyberattacks, released the NotPetya malware, and even attempted to spoof results in Ukraine’s 2014 presidential election. Now, according to Microsoft, there’s a new addition to that hyper-aggressive agency’s cyberwar-focused bench. Microsoft this week named a new group of GRU hackers that it’s calling Cadet Blizzard, and has been tracking since just before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Redmond’s cybersecurity analysts now blame Cadet Blizzard for the destructive malware known as WhisperGate, which hit an array of government agencies, nonprofits, IT organizations, and emergency services in Ukraine in January 2022, just a month before Russia’s invasion began. Microsoft also attributes to Cadet Blizzard a series of web defacements and a hack-and-leak operation known as Free Civilian that dumped the data of several Ukrainian hacking victim organizations online while loosely impersonating hacktivists, another of the GRU’s trademarks. Microsoft assesses that Cadet Blizzard appears to have the help of at least one private sector Russian firm in its hacking campaign but that it’s neither as prolific nor as sophisticated as previously known GRU groups plaguing Ukraine. But as Russia has switched up the tempo of its cyberwar, focusing on quantity rather than quality of attacks, Cadet Blizzard may play a key role in that brutal cadence of chaos. You might think that in 2023, Russian hackers would have learned not to travel to countries with US extradition treaties—not to mention a US state. But one allegedly prolific ransomware extortionist associated with the notorious Lockbit group was arrested this week in Arizona, the Department of Justice announced. Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov, a 20-year-old man living in Russia’s Chechen Republic, carried out at least five ransomware attacks against victims in Florida, Tokyo, Virginia, France, and Kenya, according to prosecutors. And in one case, he allegedly pocketed 80 of the bitcoin ransom personally. Astamirov’s arrest represents a relatively rare instance of US officials laying hands on a ransomware hacker, most of whom typically stay on Russian soil and evade arrest. It’s not yet clear why Astamirov made the mistake of traveling, but here’s hoping it’s a trend. Lots of other US-extradition countries are lovely this time of year. File this one under “complicated headlines”: According to a search warrant unearthed by Forbes, the FBI used information stolen by a hacker from a dark-web assassination market to investigate a person going by the pseudonym Bonfire—whom the FBI believes is a Louisiana hairdresser named Julie Coda—to commission the murder of her niece’s father. In fact, Bonfire was being scammed by a fake murder-for-hire service, as is almost always the case with such dark-web deals. And to compound her problems, her alleged attempted murder-for-hire was revealed to the FBI by a hacker working as an informant to the US Department of Homeland Security. To further complicate this dark, strange story, that hacker appears to have been a foreign national flipped by the DHS and convicted of possessing child sexual abuse materials. Last week it came to light that Estonia-based cryptocurrency wallet service Atomic Wallet had been breached by hackers apparently based in North Korea who stole tens of millions of dollars. Crypto analysts at Elliptic have now uncovered the larger picture of that heist and found that the hackers’ haul was in fact in the nine figures, making it one of North Korea’s biggest crypto heists in recent years. According to Elliptic, a large tranche of the funds have flowed to the Russian exchange Garantex, which was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department last year but continues to operate. 📨 Understand AI advances with our Fast Forward newsletter 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Meet the psychedelic boom’s first responders Amazon’s new robots roll out an automation revolution ChatGPT’s storytelling chops are no match for D&D How Microsoft Excel tries to rebrand work as excitement Docs show FBI pressures cops to keep phone surveillance secrets 🔌 Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs Kim Zetter Andy Greenberg Matt Burgess Matt Burgess Lily Hay Newman Tik Root Megan Greenwell Dell Cameron More From WIRED Contact\n"

Lily Hay Newman United States cybersecurity officials said yesterday that a “small number” of government agencies have suffered data breaches as part of a broad hacking campaign that is likely being carried out by the Russia-based ransomware gang Clop. The cybercriminal group has been on a tear in exploiting a vulnerability in the file transfer service MOVEit to grab valuable data from victims including Shell, British Airways, and the BBC. But hitting US government targets will only increase global law enforcement's scrutiny of the cybercriminals in the already high-profile hacking spree. Progress Software, which owns MOVEit, patched the vulnerability at the end of May, and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released an advisory with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on June 7 warning about Clop's exploitation and the urgent need for all organizations, both public and private, to patch the flaw. A senior CISA official told reporters yesterday that all US government MOVEit instances have now been updated. CISA officials declined to say which US agencies are victims of the spree, but they confirmed that the Department of Energy notified CISA that it is among them. CNN, which first reported the attacks on US government agencies, further reported today that the hacking spree impacted Louisiana and Oregon state driver's license and identification data for millions of residents. Clop has previously also claimed credit for attacks on the state governments of Minnesota and Illinois. “We are currently providing support to several federal agencies that have experienced intrusions affecting their MOVEit applications,” CISA director Jen Easterly told reporters on Thursday. “Based on discussions we have had with industry partners in the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative, these intrusions are not being leveraged to gain broader access, to gain persistence into targeted systems, or to steal specific high-value information—in sum, as we understand it, this attack is largely an opportunistic one.” Easterly added that CISA has not seen Clop threaten to release any data stolen from the US government. And the senior CISA official, who spoke to reporters on the condition that they not be named, said that CISA and its partners do not currently see evidence that Clop is coordinating with the Russian government. For its part, Clop has maintained that it is focused on targeting businesses and will delete any data from governments or law enforcement. Clop emerged in 2018 as a standard ransomware actor that would encrypt a victim's systems and then demand payment to provide the decryption key. The ransomware gang is also known for finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in widely used software and equipment to steal information from a variety of businesses and institutions and then launch data extortion campaigns against them. Allan Liska, an analyst for the security firm Recorded Future who specializes in ransomware, says that Clop was “moderately successful” with the ransomware approach. It eventually differentiated itself, though, by moving away from encryption-based ransomware and toward its current model of developing exploits for vulnerabilities in enterprise software and then using them to carry out mass data theft. And while there may not be direct coordination between the Kremlin and Clop, research has repeatedly shown ties between the Russian government and ransomware groups. Under the arrangement, these syndicates can operate from Russia with impunity so long as they don't target victims within the country and defer to the Kremlin's influence. So is Clop really deleting data it gathers, even incidentally, from government victims? “We don’t think US government agencies were specifically targeted. Clop simply hit any vulnerable server running the software,” Liska says of the MOVEit campaign. “But it is highly likely that any information Clop collected from the US government or other interesting targets was shared with the Kremlin.” Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian 📧 Get the best stories from WIRED’s iconic archive in your inbox 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Boots Riley says a “gentler capitalism” won’t save society The last 96 hours of the Titan tragedy Deepfake porn reveals a “pervert’s dilemma” Video game remakes are in a golden age.

Lily Hay Newman The United States Treasury announced on Friday that it is sanctioning the Iranian technology company Arvan Cloud, along with two senior employees of the company and an affiliated firm based in the United Arab Emirates. Officials from both the Treasury and the US State Department said on Friday that the company has close ties to Iran’s Information and Communications Technology Ministry and plays a key role in providing infrastructure for the regime's surveillance activities and restrictive intranet known as the National Information Network (NIN). US sanctions against Iran are extensive, and the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control has issued a number of sanctions specifically related to the Iranian government's long-standing attacks on internet freedom and digital access within the country. The full scope of US sanctions against Iran have already significantly isolated the country's economy, and its government's own internet shutdowns, digital blocking, and censorship have only further fueled financial hardship. But a US government official told WIRED on Friday that the Biden administration has seen consistent evidence that naming and shaming regime collaborators stifles an impacted company's ability to recruit top talent within the country. “Today is a very bad day for anyone who has Arvan Cloud listed on their résumé,” said the official, who spoke to WIRED on the condition that they not be named. “We really do see Iran as an epicenter in the global struggle over the free flow of information. You’re at a tipping point between a bifurcated series of intranets and a global internet.” The Iranian regime faced months of mass protests after 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in the custody of Iran's “morality police” in September while being held for allegedly violating rules about wearing hijab. Ever since, the government has continued to expand its NIN national intranet and tighten digital restrictions and censorship. Many Iranians still maintain access to the global internet, though, through circumvention tools like VPNs and other relay technologies. The Biden administration has specifically invested in recent years to help private companies that create circumvention tools tailor them for Iran and keep them running. This fits into a broader US policy. Since 2008, for example, the State Department has invested more than $320 million of congressionally directed funding toward global internet freedom programs, technology, and digital access research. The US Treasury also announced a special license in September, known as Iran General License D-2, that allows private companies to develop and offer digital services to Iranians without violating sanctions. A senior government official, who also spoke on background, told WIRED that at some points since the regime escalated its internet disruptions in September, 30 million Iranians—nearly one in three—were using US-supported anti-censorship tools. And the official said that usage by millions or tens of millions of Iranians is still common currently. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Developing and maintaining circumvention tools is a cat-and-mouse game in Iran and in any country that restricts digital freedom, because regimes are always looking for technological solutions to block loopholes. “We’ve seen that the regime has taken unprecedented steps to disrupt the internet and disrupt people’s access to the internet,” the senior official told WIRED. “Everyone has to assume that the regime is doing everything it can to crack down on these types of tools.” Digital rights activists working outside the country to support Iran say the US government's support of circumvention tools has been valuable. “It's certainly true that they are by far providing the highest amount of support for the main VPNs used in Iran,” says Reza Ghazinouri, a strategic adviser at United for Iran, a San Francisco–based human rights and civil liberties group. But some have reservations about the strategies the US government has used to promote internet freedom in Iran. Amir Rashidi, director of internet security and digital rights at the Iran-focused human rights organization Miaan Group, says he has concerns about the sanctions against Arvan Cloud because he worries that cracking down on key digital services in Iran simply adds more restrictions. “In any place, if you go after infrastructure, even if they're controlled by the government, sanctioning an electric company or a gas company, that's not going to help anyone,” Rashidi says. \"If you sanction internet infrastructure, you're just making the Iranian government's job a lot easier. Rashidi notes, too, that while he is not surprised that a company like Arvan has close ties to the Iranian regime, he wishes the US government would provide more detailed evidence for why it singled out this tech company to be sanctioned over any other in Iran. He points out that Arvan is seemingly the only Iranian tech company that publishes an annual transparency report of any sort—even if it is often not particularly illuminating. In July 2021, Arvan also publicly joined other Iranian tech companies and digital rights activists in opposing restrictive legislation the regime was promoting under the guise of a “user protection” bill. And on Tuesday, the company's CEO, Pouya Pirhosseinloo, one of the executives named in the US Treasury sanctions on Friday, published an essay calling for expanded internet freedom within Iran. Pirhosseinloo wrote that Iran should be focused on “removing filtering and extensive internet disruptions” as well as “removing any kind of disruptions and restrictions on internet protocols in the name of dealing with VPNs.” And he concluded by calling for a massive overhaul of Iran's approach to internet freedom. “We should accept that Iran should be taken out of global isolation, sanctions, and hope should be restored to the body of Iranian society by removing internal sanctions,” Pirhosseinloo wrote. \"Such a path will not begin until life is restored through the freedom of the Internet and the removal of its widespread disturbances and restrictions. Return to the roots of the digital economy.\" Iran's digital landscape is complicated, and efforts to influence the Iranian regime are never straightforward. “I'm not saying these people are fantastic, but they were outspoken against the Iranian government's plans,” Rashidi says. “Maybe the US government has information I don't have, but I'd like to see more evidence to back up the claim.” 📧 Get the best stories from WIRED’s iconic archive in your inbox 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Boots Riley says a “gentler capitalism” won’t save society The last 96 hours of the Titan tragedy Deepfake porn reveals a “pervert’s dilemma” Video game remakes are in a golden age.

Lily Hay Newman Officials in Spain want to ban end-to-end encryption in the European Union, according to a leaked government document obtained by WIRED. The stance emerged as part of a survey of EU member states related to legislative proposals to scan private messages for child sexual abuse material. Meanwhile, Meta faced a record $1.3 billion GDPR fine this week over data transfers to the US. And a consortium of researchers say that for the first time, they see evidence of sophisticated spyware being used in a war zone, with findings that NSO Group's Pegasus was used to target Armenian government workers, journalists, and at least one United Nations official in the Nagorno-Karabakh territory disputed by Armenia and Azerbaijan. US and international intelligence officials said on Wednesday, May 24, along with researchers at Microsoft, that a Chinese-government-backed hacking group attacked critical infrastructure networks in some US states and Guam. The activity was particularly significant because the group's behavior indicated that it may have been laying groundwork for disruptive attacks in addition to carrying out espionage. We also took a look at the notorious history of a Russian state hacking group known as Turla, which has a 25-year track record targeting satellites, developing ingenious computer worms, and earning itself the designation “adversary number one.” The ubiquitous password hashing function bcrypt was celebrating a very different kind of 25th anniversary this week, and its co-creators talked to WIRED about why the password scrambling protection has had such longevity—along with their disappointment that the state of password security has not progressed more in a quarter-century. Researchers are warning that manipulations known as indirect prompt-injection attacks could facilitate scams and data theft in generative AI systems. And new top-level domains offered by Google, including “.zip” and “.mov,” stirred controversy this month for their overlap with common file extensions and the potential that they could be abused to fuel phishing attacks. Analysis released this week showed that Chinese labs are selling fentanyl precursor ingredients wholesale online and that 90 percent of the firms accept cryptocurrency payments for the chemicals. Elsewhere, an internal security review from the hacked cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex shows how attackers exploited weaknesses in the platform's systems to steal millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. In slightly more hopeful news, though, researchers from the software supply chain company Chainguard released a new approach on Tuesday to securing a crucial yet overlooked piece of cloud infrastructure known as “container registries.” And there’s more. Each week we round up the security stories we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. The video streaming giant Netflix has been piloting an initiative around the world to cut down on account sharing outside of individual households. Now, the crackdown is finally coming to the US. This week, the company said that it will start emailing users who appear to be sharing their accounts with people who don't live in the same residence to warn them that these users will be shut out. In the US, if you have a Standard plan, you can add one extra user outside your home to the account for $7.99 per month. If you have a Premium plan with 4K streaming, you can add two extra members for $7.99 each. Netflix offers a Transfer Profile tool that people can use to set up their own accounts if they can no longer access the account they used to share. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian “We use information such as IP addresses, device IDs, and account activity to determine whether a device signed into your account is part of your Netflix Household,” Netflix has said. “We do not collect GPS data to try to determine the precise physical location of your devices.” TikTok employees have been sharing sensitive user data on an internal productivity and communication platform known as Lark. Documents obtained by The New York Times show that thousands of Chinese employees of TikTok's parent company ByteDance have access to and use Lark each day. User data shared on Lark mostly shows up in group chats, but the documents show that TikTok employees have raised concerns about the fact that ByteDance employees in China could potentially access users' personal details on the platform, like US driver's license data and even child sexual abuse material. Employees have reportedly been warning ByteDance and TikTok executives about the exposure since at least July 2021. Both TikTok and ByteDance have maintained over the years that there are barriers in place to prevent TikTok user's data from being accessed in China. An Android app known as iRecorder Screen Recorder that has been downloaded more than 50,000 times on Google Play was a legitimate app when it emerged in September 2021. But researchers from the security firm ESET found that in August 2022, the app received an update and started displaying malicious behavior. It now abuses its device microphone access to record audio every 15 minutes and send the data to a malicious server. “Unfortunately, we don’t have any evidence that the app was pushed to a particular group of people, and from the app description and further research … it isn’t clear if a specific group of people was targeted or not,” ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko wrote. “It seems very unusual.” Dozens of digital rights, pro-privacy, and civil liberties groups including Mozilla, the Tor Project, Fight for the Future, Derechos Digitales, and Abortion Access Front signed a letter calling for the workplace communication platform Slack to implement end-to-end encryption on its platform. Slack has long been criticized for failing to provide an end-to-end encryption option, which would cut down on governments' ability to access and surveil Slack messages, but the letter is the most organized commentary yet. “For many of these groups and individuals, Slack is an absolutely vital communication tool, but it could also become the basis of government targeting, repression, censorship,” the organizations wrote. “Default end-to-end encrypted messaging [is] a first and best step companies can take to protect targeted communities.” 📧 Get the best stories from WIRED’s iconic archive in your inbox 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Boots Riley says a “gentler capitalism” won’t save society The last 96 hours of the Titan tragedy Deepfake porn reveals a “pervert’s dilemma” Video game remakes are in a golden age.

Lily Hay Newman Andy Greenberg Apple's Worldwide Developer's Conference this week included an array of announcements about operating system releases and, of course, the company's anticipated mixed-reality headset, Vision Pro. Apple also announced that it is expanding on-device nudity detection for children's accounts as part of its efforts to combat the creation and distribution of child sexual abuse material. The company also debuted more flexible nudity detection for adults. Internal documents obtained by WIRED revealed new details this week about how the imageboard platform 4chan does, and does not, moderate content—resulting in a violent and bigoted morass. Researchers like a group at the University of Texas, Austin, are increasingly developing support resources and clinics that institutions like local governments and small businesses can lean on for critical cybersecurity advice and assistance. Meanwhile, cybercriminals are expanding their use of artificial intelligence tools to generate content for scams, but defenders are also incorporating AI into their detection strategies. New insight from North Korean defectors illustrates the fraught digital landscape within the reclusive nation. Surveillance, censorship, and monitoring are rampant for North Koreans who can get online, and millions of others have no digital access. And research released this week from the internet infrastructure company Cloudflare sheds light on the digital threats facing participants in the company's Project Galileo program, which provides free protections to civil society and human rights organizations around the world.And there’s more. Each week we round up the security stories we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. The US Department of Justice on Friday indicted two Russian men, Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner, for the 650,000-bitcoin hack of Mt. Gox. The two appear to have been charged in absentia while evading arrest in Russia—unlike one of their alleged accomplices, Alexander Vinnik, who was previously convicted in 2020. Bilyuchenko and Verner are accused of breaching Mt. Gox in 2011, in the earliest days of that original bitcoin exchange's founding. The DOJ says they slowly siphoned out coins from the exchange for three years until Mt. Gox revealed the theft and declared bankruptcy in February 2014. In the meantime, Bilyuchenko and Vinnik allegedly created an entire other exchange, BTC-e, to launder the proceeds of this massive hack. In the years that followed, BTC-e became a giant cash-out point for criminal cryptocurrency of every kind. The new indictment against Bilyuchenko and Verner offers only a mixed resolution to the case of one of the biggest-ever cybercriminal thefts. By unsealing the new indictment, the DOJ may be tacitly acknowledging that it won't ever have a chance to lay hands on the two men. The indictment against Vinnik, by contrast, was kept sealed for years until he made the mistake of going on vacation to Greece in 2017. After years in prison in France, Vinnik has now been extradited to face charges in the US, where he's lobbying to be swapped for imprisoned Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. Critics of end-to-end encryption tools and anonymous networks like the dark web often point to the creation and sharing of child sexual abuse material, or CSAM, as the worst consequence of those tools' privacy. But a new study from The Wall Street Journal, the Stanford Internet Observatory, and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst found a vast network of child exploitation images and videos being sold and even commissioned on Instagram's open, public network. And in some cases, its automated recommendation algorithms even promoted more CSAM materials to users who sought that horrific content. The researchers discovered that certain hashtags on Instagram such as #pedobait and #mnsfw (or \"minor not-safe-for-work\") led users to hidden—but fully public—groups of hundreds of accounts where CSAM was freely advertised, and where users could commission images and videos of sexual acts and self-harm. In some cases, the accounts even offered to sell in-person sexual encounters with children. And when users sought those vile materials, Instagram's algorithms actively promoted more to them, the researchers found, even as it also posted interstitial warnings to the users that the content was illegal and causes “extreme harm” to children. In response to the study, Instagram has changed those interstitials to block CSAM content rather than merely warn users about its consequences, and Instagram's parent company, Meta, says it's created a new task force to address the problem. The researchers found that Twitter, too, hosted 128 accounts selling CSAM materials. But that number was less than a third of the 408 accounts selling CSAM on Instagram's much larger network. The notorious Russia-linked ransomware gang known as Clop took responsibility on Monday for stealing data from what it claims amounts to “hundreds of companies” through a vulnerability in the file-transfer service MOVEit Transfer. Microsoft first attributed the activity to the group on Sunday. Clop is known for exploiting vulnerabilities in popular enterprise web services or equipment to steal data and launch extortion campaigns against a number of organizations at once. The group began attacking the MOVEit Transfer vulnerability at the end of May. Another week, another massive crypto heist linked to the Hermit Kingdom's hackers. Last weekend, the independent blockchain analysis sleuth who goes by the name ZachXBT on Twitter posted evidence of $35 million being siphoned out of the addresses of the cryptocurrency firm Atomic Wallet. He found that just five users of the hosted cryptocurrency wallet service had lost $17 million, and one had lost $8 million. “Unfortunately, with the occurrence of this terrifying hack, my life has been disrupted,” one Turkish user who lost their life savings told Fortune. Cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic quickly found blockchain evidence tying the hack to North Korean state-sponsored hackers. The funds had flowed into Sinbad.io, a cryptocurrency “mixing” service that has quickly become the Kim regime's preferred crypto laundering tool. If the Atomic Wallet was indeed carried out by North Korea—as all signs indicate—it would be the biggest crypto theft the country's hackers have pulled off since the $100 million pillaging of Horizon Bridge a year ago.

Lily Hay Newman Andy Greenberg The Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has made headlines for years by exposing sophisticated hacking by Russian and Western state-sponsored cyberspies alike. Now it’s exposing a stealthy new intrusion campaign where Kaspersky itself was a target. In a report published today, Kaspersky said that at the beginning of the year, it detected targeted attacks against a group of iPhones after analyzing the company’s own corporate network traffic. The campaign, which the researchers call Operation Triangulation and say is “ongoing,” appears to date back to 2019 and utilized multiple vulnerabilities in Apple’s iOS mobile operating system to let attackers take control of victim devices. Kaspersky says the attack chain utilized “zero-click” exploitation to compromise targets’ devices by simply sending a specially crafted message to victims over Apple’s iMessage service. Victims received the message, which included a malicious attachment, and exploitation would begin whether victims opened the message and inspected the attachment or not. Then the attack would chain together multiple vulnerabilities to give the hackers deeper and deeper access to the target’s device. And the final malware payload would automatically download to the victim’s device before the original malicious message and attachment self-deleted. Kaspersky’s revelation of the new iOS hacking campaign comes on the same day that Russia’s FSB intelligence service separately announced a claim that the US National Security Agency has hacked thousands of Russians’ phones. Even more remarkably, the FSB claimed that Apple had participated in that broad hacking of iOS devices, willingly providing vulnerabilities to the NSA to exploit in its spying operations. Apple said in a statement to WIRED, “We have never worked with any government to insert a backdoor into any Apple product and never will.” When asked about Kaspersky’s report, an Apple spokesperson noted that the findings only appear to pertain to iPhones running iOS version 15.7 and below. The current version of iOS is 16.5. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Kaspersky says that the malware it discovered cannot persist on a device once it is rebooted, but the researchers say they saw evidence of reinfection in some cases. The exact nature of the vulnerabilities used in the exploit chain remains unclear, though Kaspersky says that one of the flaws was likely the kernel extension vulnerability CVE-2022-46690 that Apple patched in December. Zero-click vulnerabilities can exist on any platform, but in recent years, attackers and spyware vendors have focused on finding these flaws in Apple’s iOS, often in iMessage, and exploiting them to launch targeted attacks on iPhones. This is partly because services like iMessage present unusually fertile ground within iOS for discovering vulnerabilities, but also because attacks on iOS devices with this approach are often very difficult for victims to detect. “Kaspersky, arguably one of the best exploit detection companies in the world, was potentially hacked via an iOS zero-day for five years, and it was only discovered now,” says longtime macOS and iOS security researcher Patrick Wardle. “That shows how ridiculously hard it is to detect these exploits and attacks.” In their report, the Kaspersky researchers point out that one of the reasons for this difficulty is iOS’s locked-down design, which makes it very tough to inspect the operating system’s activity. “The security of iOS, once breached, makes it really challenging to detect these attacks,” says Wardle, who was formerly an NSA staffer. At the same time, he adds that attackers would need to assume any brazen campaign to target Kaspersky would eventually be discovered. “In my opinion, this would be sloppy for an NSA attack,” he says. “But it shows that either hacking Kaspersky was incredibly valuable for the attacker or that whoever this was likely has other iOS zero days as well. If you only have one exploit, you’re not going to risk your only iOS remote attack to hack Kaspersky.” The NSA declined WIRED’s request for comment on either the FSB announcement or Kaspersky’s findings. With the release of iOS 16 in September 2022, Apple introduced a special security setting for the mobile operating system known as Lockdown Mode that intentionally restricts usability and access to features that can be porous within services like iMessage and Apple’s WebKit. It is not known whether Lockdown Mode would have prevented the attacks Kaspersky observed. The Russian government’s purported discovery of Apple’s collusion with US intelligence “testifies to the close cooperation of the American company Apple with the national intelligence community, in particular the US NSA, and confirms that the declared policy of ensuring the confidentiality of personal data of users of Apple devices is not true,” claims an FSB statement, which adds that it would allow the NSA and “partners in anti-Russian activities” to target “any person of interest to the White House,” as well as US citizens. The FSB statement wasn’t accompanied by any technical details of the described NSA spy campaign, or any evidence that Apple colluded in it. Apple has historically resisted pressure to provide a “backdoor” or other vulnerability to US law enforcement or intelligence agencies. That stance was demonstrated most publicly in Apple’s high-profile 2016 showdown with the FBI over the bureau’s demand that Apple assist in the decryption of an iPhone used by San Bernadino mass shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. The standoff only ended when the FBI found its own method of accessing the iPhone’s storage with the help of Australian cybersecurity firm Azimuth. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Despite its announcement coming on the same day as the FSB’s claims, Kaspersky has so far made no claims that the Operation Triangulation hackers who targeted the company were working on behalf of the NSA. Nor has the cybersecurity firm attributed the hacking to the Equation Group, Kaspersky’s name for the state-sponsored hackers it has previously tied to highly sophisticated malware, including Stuxnet and Duqu, tools widely believed to have been created and deployed by the NSA and US allies. Kaspersky did say in a statement to WIRED that, “Given the sophistication of the cyberespionage campaign and the complexity of analysis of the iOS platform, further research will surely reveal more details on the matter.” US intelligence agencies and US allies would, of course, have plenty of reason to want to look over Kaspersky’s shoulder. Aside from years of warnings from the US government that Kaspersky has ties to the Russian government, the company’s researchers have long demonstrated their willingness to track and expose hacking campaigns conducted by Western governments that Western cybersecurity firms don’t. In 2015, in fact, Kaspersky revealed that its own network had been breached by hackers who used a variant of the Duqu malware, suggesting a link to the Equation Group—and thus potentially the NSA. That history, combined with the sophistication of the malware that targeted Kaspersky, suggests that as wild as the FSB’s claims may be, there’s good reason to imagine that Kaspersky’s intruders could have ties to a government. But if you hack one of the world’s most prolific trackers of state-sponsored hackers—even with seamless, tough-to-detect iPhone malware—you can expect, sooner or later, to get caught. 📧 Get the best stories from WIRED’s iconic archive in your inbox 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Boots Riley says a “gentler capitalism” won’t save society The last 96 hours of the Titan tragedy Deepfake porn reveals a “pervert’s dilemma” Video game remakes are in a golden age.

Andy Greenberg Hiding malicious programs in a computer’s UEFI firmware, the deep-seated code that tells a PC how to load its operating system, has become an insidious trick in the toolkit of stealthy hackers. But when a motherboard manufacturer installs its own hidden backdoor in the firmware of millions of computers—and doesn’t even put a proper lock on that hidden back entrance—they’re practically doing hackers’ work for them. Researchers at firmware-focused cybersecurity company Eclypsium revealed today that they’ve discovered a hidden mechanism in the firmware of motherboards sold by the Taiwanese manufacturer Gigabyte, whose components are commonly used in gaming PCs and other high-performance computers. Whenever a computer with the affected Gigabyte motherboard restarts, Eclypsium found, code within the motherboard’s firmware invisibly initiates an updater program that runs on the computer and in turn downloads and executes another piece of software. While Eclypsium says the hidden code is meant to be an innocuous tool to keep the motherboard’s firmware updated, researchers found that it’s implemented insecurely, potentially allowing the mechanism to be hijacked and used to install malware instead of Gigabyte’s intended program. And because the updater program is triggered from the computer’s firmware, outside its operating system, it’s tough for users to remove or even discover. “If you have one of these machines, you have to worry about the fact that it’s basically grabbing something from the internet and running it without you being involved, and hasn’t done any of this securely,” says John Loucaides, who leads strategy and research at Eclypsium. “The concept of going underneath the end user and taking over their machine doesn’t sit well with most people.” In its blog post about the research, Eclypsium lists 271 models of Gigabyte motherboards that researchers say are affected. Loucaides adds that users who want to see which motherboard their computer uses can check by going to “Start” in Windows and then “System Information.” Eclypsium says it found Gigabyte’s hidden firmware mechanism while scouring customers’ computers for firmware-based malicious code, an increasingly common tool employed by sophisticated hackers. In 2018, for instance, hackers working on behalf of Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency were discovered silently installing the firmware-based anti-theft software LoJack on victims’ machines as a spying tactic. Chinese state-sponsored hackers were spotted two years later repurposing a firmware-based spyware tool created by the hacker-for-hire firm Hacking Team to target the computers of diplomats and NGO staff in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Eclypsium’s researchers were surprised to see their automated detection scans flag Gigabyte’s updater mechanism for carrying out some of the same shady behavior as those state-sponsored hacking tools—hiding in firmware and silently installing a program that downloads code from the internet. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Gigabyte’s updater alone might have raised concerns for users who don’t trust Gigabyte to silently install code on their machine with a nearly invisible tool—or who worry that Gigabyte’s mechanism could be exploited by hackers who compromise the motherboard manufacturer to exploit its hidden access in a software supply chain attack. But Eclypsium also found that the update mechanism was implemented with glaring vulnerabilities that could allow it to be hijacked: It downloads code to the user’s machine without properly authenticating it, sometimes even over an unprotected HTTP connection, rather than HTTPS. This would allow the installation source to be spoofed by a man-in-the-middle attack carried out by anyone who can intercept the user’s internet connection, such as a rogue Wi-Fi network. In other cases, the updater installed by the mechanism in Gigabyte’s firmware is configured to be downloaded from a local network-attached storage device (NAS), a feature that appears to be designed for business networks to administer updates without all of their machines reaching out to the internet. But Eclypsium warns that in those cases, a malicious actor on the same network could spoof the location of the NAS to invisibly install their own malware instead. Gigabyte did not respond to WIRED’s multiple requests for comment regarding Eclypsium’s findings. But a day after Eclypsium revealed the firmware issue, Gigabyte announced updates to its firmware with \"enhanced verification\" of the code its updater program downloads to machines that use its motherboards. According to Gigabyte, that code is now cryptographically signed and verified, \"thwarting any attempts by attackers to insert malicious code,\" and the server they're downloaded from is also authenticated with a cryptographic certificate. Release notes accompanying the update state that it \"addresses download assistant vulnerabilities\" uncovered by Eclypsium. Even now that Gigabyte has pushed out a fix for its firmware issue—after all, the problem stems from a Gigabyte tool intended to automate firmware updates—Eclypsium’s Loucaides points out that firmware updates often silently abort on users’ machines, in many cases due to their complexity and the difficulty of matching firmware and hardware. “I still think this will end up being a fairly pervasive problem on Gigabyte boards for years to come,” Loucaides says. Given the millions of potentially affected devices, Eclypsium’s discovery is “troubling,” says Rich Smith, who is the chief security officer of supply-chain-focused cybersecurity startup Crash Override. Smith has published research on firmware vulnerabilities and reviewed Eclypsium’s findings. He compares the situation to the Sony rootkit scandal of the mid-2000s. Sony had hidden digital-rights-management code on CDs that invisibly installed itself on users’ computers and in doing so created a vulnerability that hackers used to hide their malware. “You can use techniques that have traditionally been used by malicious actors, but that wasn’t acceptable, it crossed the line,” Smith says. “I can’t speak to why Gigabyte chose this method to deliver their software. But for me, this feels like it crosses a similar line in the firmware space.” Smith acknowledges that Gigabyte probably had no malicious or deceptive intent in its hidden firmware tool. But by leaving security vulnerabilities in the invisible code that lies beneath the operating system of so many computers, it nonetheless erodes a fundamental layer of trust users have in their machines. “There’s no intent here, just sloppiness. But I don’t want anyone writing my firmware who’s sloppy,” says Smith. “If you don’t have trust in your firmware, you’re building your house on sand.” Update 9:30 am, Tuesday, June 6, 2023: Following publication, Gigabyte announced the release of updates to its firmware. The company says the additional secure measures will better protect users of its affected motherboards from “attempts by attackers to insert malicious code.” 📧 Get the best stories from WIRED’s iconic archive in your inbox 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Boots Riley says a “gentler capitalism” won’t save society The last 96 hours of the Titan tragedy Deepfake porn reveals a “pervert’s dilemma” Video game remakes are in a golden age.

Lily Hay Newman internet infrastructure company Cloudflare has offered the free web security service Project Galileo for nearly a decade, giving human rights and public interest organizations around the world access to defenses against DDoS attacks and other common online hacking techniques. More than 2,271 websites in 111 countries now use the service, including 81 Ukrainian organizations, the majority of which joined after the Russian invasion in February 2022. The main aim of Project Galileo is simply to utilize Cloudflare’s products and scale for organizations that might not otherwise have any web defenses at all. By examining the threats that different participants are facing, the company hopes to also raise awareness about what could be coming next. In Ukraine, for example, Cloudflare found that emergency response services in numerous cities that are enrolled in Project Galileo—including those that perform search and rescue; offer medical care; and distribute supplies like food, water, and medicine—face spikes of malicious traffic concurrent with Russian bombings. Many of the other Ukrainian organizations that use Project Galileo are human rights groups or work in independent media and journalism. They often see increases in attacks around moments of international controversy, like when Russia assumed the presidency of the United Nations Security Council on April 1. In a report released today, Cloudflare delved into data on attack trends across Project Galileo participants, including those in Ukraine, abortion and reproductive rights organizations, and LGBTQ+ groups. The company says that between July 1, 2022 and May 5, 2023, it mitigated 20 billion attacks against Project Galileo enrollees. “We’re not specifically placing blame for the sources of the attacks,” says David Belson, Cloudflare’s head of data insight. “But we’re seeing things play out in new and unique ways. In Ukraine, if Russia is trying to attack them physically, and then an actor is trying to prevent them from getting access to the sites that provide emergency resources on the digital side, it’s a new facet in warfare.” Since last summer, Project Galileo mitigated an average of 790,000 attacks per day against LGBTQ+ organizations and an average of 1.52 million per day against reproductive rights groups, Cloudflare says. In addition to defending against DDoS attacks—firehoses of junk traffic meant to deluge a site and take it down—more and more of the defense Project Galileo provides comes from Cloudflare’s Web Application Firewall. The service helps defend sites against actual web application vulnerability exploitation, including hackers’ attempts to launch common attacks like injecting malicious scripts and manipulating databases. “In those cases, it means that the attacks were less brute force—‘I’m going to try to knock this site down by throwing a load of garbage traffic at it’—and maybe a slightly more mature type of attack, probing to try to find a way in,” Belson says. “The intent then is not to take them down, but to do something arguably more malicious, like exfiltrate data.” Defending small or under-resourced sites against DDoS attacks is still a key component of Project Galileo’s offering, though. And Cloudflare researchers emphasize that it’s important for sites to have some sort of protection in place, even if they’ve never been targeted before, because sites with low daily traffic, like those that provide resources to small or regional audiences, can so easily be overwhelmed by an unexpected DDoS attack. “The goal is to provide some background for civil society groups to make them think about what they should be protecting against and show that these threats are real,” says Alissa Starzak, Cloudflare’s vice president and global head of public policy. “We often see attacks against websites if there are things happening in the physical world—controversy about a subject, focus on a particular topic. The organizations that are targeted are the ones that are navigating that.” Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian 📩 Don’t miss our biggest stories, delivered to your inbox every day 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future The night 17 million military records went up in smoke The AI protest group campaigning against human extinction How your new car tracks you A grid collapse would make a heat wave far deadlier WIRED’s favorite “buy it for life” gear 🌲 Our Gear team has branched out with a new guide to the best sleeping pads and fresh picks for the best coolers and binoculars Scott Gilbertson Tik Root Megan Greenwell Dell Cameron Dhruv Mehrotra Matt Burgess Matt Burgess Lily Hay Newman More From WIRED Contact\n"

Dell Cameron The United States government has been secretly amassing a “large amount” of “sensitive and intimate information” on its own citizens, a group of senior advisers informed Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, more than a year ago. The size and scope of the government effort to accumulate data revealing the minute details of Americans' lives are described soberly and at length by the director's own panel of experts in a newly declassified report. Haines had first tasked her advisers in late 2021 with untangling a web of secretive business arrangements between commercial data brokers and US intelligence community members. What that report ended up saying constitutes a nightmare scenario for privacy defenders. “This report reveals what we feared most,” says Sean Vitka, a policy attorney at the nonprofit Demand Progress. “Intelligence agencies are flouting the law and buying information about Americans that Congress and the Supreme Court have made clear the government should not have.” In the shadow of years of inaction by the US Congress on comprehensive privacy reform, a surveillance state has been quietly growing in the legal system's cracks. Little deference is paid by prosecutors to the purpose or intent behind limits traditionally imposed on domestic surveillance activities. More craven interpretations of aging laws are widely used to ignore them. As the framework guarding what privacy Americans do have grows increasingly frail, opportunities abound to split hairs in court over whether such rights are even enjoyed by our digital counterparts. “I’ve been warning for years that if using a credit card to buy an American’s personal information voids their Fourth Amendment rights, then traditional checks and balances for government surveillance will crumble,” Ron Wyden, a US senator from Oregon, says. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. WIRED was unable to reach any members of the senior advisory panel, whose names have been redacted in the report. Former members have included ex-CIA officials of note and top defense industry leaders. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Wyden had pressed Haines, previously the number two at the Central Intelligence Agency, to release the panel's report during a March 8 hearing. Haines replied at the time that she believed it “absolutely” should be read by the public. On Friday, the report was declassified and released by the ODNI, which has been embroiled in a legal fight with the digital rights nonprofit the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) over a host of related documents. “This report makes it clear that the government continues to think it can buy its way out of constitutional protections using taxpayers’ own money,\" says Chris Baumohl, a law fellow at EPIC. “Congress must tackle the government’s data broker pipeline this year, before it considers any reauthorization of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,” he said (referring to the ongoing political fight over the so-called “crown jewel” of US surveillance). The ODNI's own panel of advisers makes clear that the government’s static interpretations of what constitutes “publicly available information” poses a significant threat to the public. The advisers decry existing policies that automatically conflate being able to buy information with it being considered “public.” The information being commercially sold about Americans today is “more revealing, available on more people (in bulk), less possible to avoid, and less well understood” than that which is traditionally thought of as being “publicly available.” Perhaps most controversially, the report states that the government believes it can “persistently” track the phones of “millions of Americans” without a warrant, so long as it pays for the information. Were the government to simply demand access to a device's location instead, it would be considered a Fourth Amendment “search” and would require a judge's sign-off. But because companies are willing to sell the information—not only to the US government but to other companies as well—the government considers it “publicly available” and therefore asserts that it “can purchase it.” It is no secret, the report adds, that it is often trivial “to deanonymize and identify individuals” from data that was packaged as ethically fine for commercial use because it had been “anonymized” first. Such data may be useful, it says, to “identify every person who attended a protest or rally based on their smartphone location or ad-tracking records.” Such civil liberties concerns are prime examples of how “large quantities of nominally ‘public’ information can result in sensitive aggregations.” What's more, information collected for one purpose “may be reused for other purposes,” which may “raise risks beyond those originally calculated,” an effect called “mission creep.” Most Americans have at least some idea of how a law enforcement investigation unfolds (if only from watching years of police procedurals). This idea imagines a cop whose ability to surveil them, turn their phone into a tracking device, or start squeezing records out of businesses they frequent, are all gated behind evidentiary thresholds, like reasonable doubt and probable cause. These are legal hurdles that no longer bother an increasing number of government agencies. Access to the most sensitive information about a person was once usually obtained in the course of a “targeted” and “predicated” investigation, the report says. Not anymore. “Today, in a way that far fewer Americans seem to understand, and even fewer of them can avoid, [commercially available information] includes information on nearly everyone,” it says. Both the “volume and sensitivity” of information the government can purchase has exploded in recent years due to “location-tracking and other features of smartphones,” and the “advertising-based monetization model” that underlies much of the internet, the report says. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian “In the wrong hands,” the ODNI’s advisers warn, the same mountain of data the government is quietly accumulating could be turned against Americans to “facilitate blackmail, stalking, harassment, and public shaming.” Notably, these are all offenses that have been committed by intelligence agencies and White House administrations in the past. What constraints do exist on domestic surveillance activities are all a direct response to that history of political sabotage, disinformation, and abusive violations of Americans' rights. The report notes: “The government would never have been permitted to compel billions of people to carry location tracking devices on their persons at all times, to log and track most of their social interactions, or to keep flawless records of all their reading habits. Yet smartphones, connected cars, web tracking technologies, the Internet of Things, and other innovations have had this effect without government participation.” The government must appreciate that all of this unfettered access can quickly increase its own power “to peer into private lives to levels that may exceed our constitutional traditions or other social expectations,” the advisers say, even if it can't blind itself to the fact that all this information exists and is readily sold for a buck. 📩 Don’t miss our biggest stories, delivered to your inbox every day 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future The night 17 million military records went up in smoke The AI protest group campaigning against human extinction How your new car tracks you A grid collapse would make a heat wave far deadlier WIRED’s favorite “buy it for life” gear 🌲 Our Gear team has branched out with a new guide to the best sleeping pads and fresh picks for the best coolers and binoculars Scott Gilbertson Tik Root Megan Greenwell Dell Cameron Dhruv Mehrotra Matt Burgess Matt Burgess Lily Hay Newman More From WIRED Contact\n"

David Nield The AI landscape has started to move very, very fast: consumer-facing tools such as Midjourney and ChatGPT are now able to produce incredible image and text results in seconds based on natural language prompts, and we're seeing them get deployed everywhere from web search to children's books. However, these AI applications are being turned to more nefarious uses, including spreading malware. Take the traditional scam email, for example: It's usually littered with obvious mistakes in its grammar and spelling—mistakes that the latest group of AI models don't make, as noted in a recent advisory report from Europol. Think about it: A lot of phishing attacks and other security threats rely on social engineering, duping users into revealing passwords, financial information, or other sensitive data. The persuasive, authentic-sounding text required for these scams can now be pumped out quite easily, with no human effort required, and endlessly tweaked and refined for specific audiences. In the case of ChatGPT, it's important to note first that developer OpenAI has built safeguards into it. Ask it to \"write malware\" or a \"phishing email\" and it will tell you that it's \"programmed to follow strict ethical guidelines that prohibit me from engaging in any malicious activities, including writing or assisting with the creation of malware.\" ChatGPT won't code malware for you, but it's polite about it. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian However, these protections aren't too difficult to get around: ChatGPT can certainly code, and it can certainly compose emails. Even if it doesn't know it's writing malware, it can be prompted into producing something like it. There are already signs that cybercriminals are working to get around the safety measures that have been put in place. We're not particularly picking on ChatGPT here, but pointing out what's possible once large language models (LLMs) like it are used for more sinister purposes. Indeed, it's not too difficult to imagine criminal organizations developing their own LLMs and similar tools in order to make their scams sound more convincing. And it's not just text either: Audio and video are more difficult to fake, but it's happening as well. When it comes to your boss asking for a report urgently, or company tech support telling you to install a security patch, or your bank informing you there's a problem you need to respond to—all these potential scams rely on building up trust and sounding genuine, and that's something AI bots are doing very well at. They can produce text, audio, and video that sounds natural and tailored to specific audiences, and they can do it quickly and constantly on demand. So is there any hope for us mere humans in the wave of these AI-powered threats? Is the only option to give up and accept our fate? Not quite. There are still ways you can minimize your chances of getting scammed by the latest technology, and they aren't so different from the precautions you should already be thinking about. There are two types of AI-related security threats to think about. The first involves tools such as ChatGPT or Midjourney being used to get you to install something you shouldn't, like a browser plugin. You could be tricked into paying for a service when you don't need to, perhaps, or using a tool that looks official but isn't. To avoid falling into these traps, make sure you're up to date with what's happening with AI services like the ones we've mentioned, and always go to the original source first. In the case of ChatGPT for example, there's no officially approved mobile app, and the tool is web-only. The standard rules apply when working with these apps and their spinoffs: Check their history, the reviews associated with them, and the companies behind them, just as you would when installing any new piece of software. The second type of threat is potentially more dangerous: AI that’s used to create text, audio, or video that sounds convincingly real. The output might even be used to mimic someone you know—like the case of the voice recording purportedly from a chief executive asking for an urgent release of funds, which duped a company employee. While the technology may have evolved, the same techniques are still being used to try and get you to do something urgently that feels slightly (or very) unusual. Take your time, double-check wherever possible using different methods (a phone call to check an email or vice versa), and watch out for red flags—a time limit on what you're being asked to do, or a task that's out of the ordinary. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian As always, keep your software and systems up to date. Following links you're not expecting from texts and emails is usually not a good idea, especially when you're being asked to log in somewhere. If your bank has apparently got in touch with a message, for example, go to the bank website directly in your browser to log in, rather than following any embedded link. Keeping your operating systems, apps, and browsers up to date is a must (and this mostly happens automatically now, so there's no excuse). The most recent browsers will protect you against a whole host of phishing and scam attacks, whether the prompt designed to dupe you has been generated by AI or not. There's no foolproof tool for detecting the presence of AI text, audio, or video at the moment, but there are certain signs to look out for: Think blurring and inconsistencies in pictures, or text that sounds generic and vague. While scammers may have scraped details about your life or your workplace from somewhere, it's unlikely that they know all the ins and outs of your operations. In short, be cautious and question everything—that was true before the dawn of these new AI services, and it's true now. Like the face-morphing masks of the Mission: Impossible film series (which remain science fiction for now), you need to be absolutely sure that you're dealing with who you think you're dealing with before revealing anything. 📧 Get the best stories from WIRED’s iconic archive in your inbox 🎧 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Boots Riley says a “gentler capitalism” won’t save society The last 96 hours of the Titan tragedy Deepfake porn reveals a “pervert’s dilemma” Video game remakes are in a golden age.

Megan Greenwell Before the flames raced down the 700-foot-long aisles of the sixth floor, before the columns of smoke rose from the roof like Jack’s beanstalk, before the wind scattered military records around the neighborhoods northwest of St. Louis, before 42 local fire departments battled for days to save one of the largest federal office buildings in the United States, before the government spent 50-plus years sorting through the charred remains, Kathy Trieschmann sensed a faint haze. Trieschmann, who has asthma, had always been hyper-attuned to tiny changes in air quality. Growing up, she would often sleep in the basement because she could smell her father’s cigarette smoke through her bedroom door. So shortly after midnight on July 12, 1973, as she walked up the stairs of the massive National Personnel Records Center to clock out, she was one of the first to know something was wrong. That spring, as a freshman at St. Louis University, Trieschmann had received high marks on a placement exam for federal jobs, earning her a summer internship at the records center. The massive office building, a branch of the National Archives and Records Administration, held paper records for every American veteran or former federal government worker who had served in the 20th century. Trieschmann’s job, along with that of two dozen fellow interns, was to check the names and Social Security numbers of Vietnam War veterans, the last of whom had just come home, before the information was entered into the NPRC’s computer system. The work didn’t satisfy her creative drive—she’d go on to teach art in public schools for decades—but it was a step up from the Six Flags amusement park where she’d worked the previous summer. She earned $3.25 an hour, about twice the minimum wage. The summer interns worked from 4 pm to 12:30 am so they wouldn’t interfere with the employees who needed access to the files during regular hours. Except for a 30-minute dinner break at a nearby Burger King, they didn’t have much time to socialize; each of them was expected to verify between 1,200 and 1,400 records every shift, and their work stations were scattered across the 200,000-square-foot second floor. Often, Trieschmann says, she would go a couple of hours without seeing anyone at all. In the very early morning of July 12th, Treischmann finished her records and registered them with a file clerk in the building’s basement. Then she headed upstairs to go home. In the stairwell, she bumped into three fellow interns who were also on their way out, and mentioned the faint difference in the air. The group decided to investigate, and continued climbing the central stairway. When the students opened the door to the third floor, the air seemed thicker. They kept going. The fourth floor was murkier still, the fifth even worse. Trieschmann never considered turning back. She has always loved adventure; she used to go scuba diving in ocean caves. Something interesting was happening, and she wanted to know what it was. So she and her colleagues climbed one more flight of stairs, to a door that opened into the sixth and top floor. She remembered that this was where the older military records were kept, the ones from World War I, World War II, and Korea, but she hadn’t been up here since orientation. Now, as she pulled open the door, she saw the cardboard boxes neatly stacked on metal shelves as far as the eye could see. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian They were on fire. Had the group gone up a staircase on the periphery of the building and not the central one, Trieschmann likely would have seen only a thick cloud of smoke. Instead, she witnessed the earliest stage of a blaze that would occupy hundreds of firefighters for days. She began running back down the flights of stairs. “The records are on fire,” she shouted at the security guard, then watched as he picked up the phone to dial for help. The first call came into the emergency services dispatcher at 12:16 and 15 seconds. Twenty seconds later came another; a motorcyclist cruising by the building had seen smoke coming from the roof, and told another security guard. By 12:20, multiple emergency vehicles were on the scene. At first, firefighters rushed into the building, but soon turned back: The smoke was too thick and the flames too intense to safely work from inside. They were relegated to spraying water onto the roof and through the large windows that lined the building. It was about as effective as trying to stop a stampede with a traffic cone. Along with the interns, a few dozen other people worked the night shift. Most were custodians assigned to mop the floors, scrub the toilets, and empty the trash before employees arrived for work in the morning. According to an FBI investigation, few of them had any idea anything was wrong that night until they walked into the lobby to go home around 12:30 am and found out that the sixth floor was burning. After Trieschmann asked the guard to call the fire department, she left the building, but she didn’t go home. Instead, she and her three fellow interns walked out to the far edge of the parking lot, plopped down on the curb, and watched. They sat there for more than six hours, staring in horror as the flames grew exponentially bigger. “I had never seen a house on fire in real life, only in movies,” she says. “We knew this was people’s lives.” As the sun rose and the fire continued to intensify, Trieschmann was one of the few people on Earth who could even begin to grasp the magnitude of what was happening at 9700 Page Avenue.

Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian The National Personnel Records Center fire burned out of control for two days before firefighters were able to begin putting it out. Photos show the roof ablaze, a nearly 5-acre field of flame. The steel beams that had once held up the glass walls jut at unnatural angles, like so many broken legs. As soon as the smoke began to clear, on the morning of July 16, National Archives employees sprinted in to try to save as many records as they could. Their primary goal was to prevent the boxes of files from drowning in water from the firefighters’ hoses. One discovered a clever hack: Squirting dish soap onto the rubber escalator handrails allowed them to gently but speedily evacuate wet boxes. Margaret Stender, now a partial owner of the Chicago Sky WNBA team, was a teenager in Alexandria, Virginia, at the time; her father, Walter W. Stender, was the assistant US archivist. Before she woke up on the morning of July 12, her dad had rushed off to the airport to fly to St. Louis, where he stayed for several weeks. He never told her much about the actual work at the records center before he died in 2018. But at her home in Chicago, Stender has a photo of her dad wearing a hard hat and carrying a box of records out of the building. “I thought he had a boring library job, and then all of a sudden he was rushing into a burning building like a superhero,” Stender says, laughing. The employees’ quick work saved many records on the five lower floors from extensive water damage. But the sixth floor, the one devoured by flames, held Army and Air Force personnel files from the first half of the 20th century. It was clear that the losses would be immense, but it would take weeks for the government to grasp the full toll. An Official Military Personnel File documents almost every element of a person’s time in the military. It includes the date they enlisted, their training history, unit information, rank and job type, and the date they left. It often lists any injuries, awards, and disciplinary actions, along with every place they ever served. The file contains a record that unlocks home, business, and educational loans; health insurance and medical treatment; life insurance; job training programs; and other perks the country has long considered part of the debt it owes its veterans. If a prospective employer needs to verify whether a soldier was honorably discharged or a military cemetery wants to know whether someone is eligible for burial, they can get those answers from the OMPF. At the time, the federal government preserved exactly one copy of the Official Military Personnel File of every veteran. For the 22 million soldiers who served in the Army during World War I, World War II, the Korean War, or any of the myriad smaller conflicts in the first half of the 20th century, that single copy lived on the sixth floor of the National Personnel Records Center, stuffed into one of those cardboard boxes. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian A few weeks after the fire, National Archives staff went public with the terrible news: Eighty percent of the Official Military Personnel Files for people who served in the Army between 1912 and 1960 were gone. Seventy-five percent of Air Force personnel records from before 1964 were too—except for those belonging to people whose names came alphabetically before Hubbard; their files were stored in a corner of the floor that didn’t burn. Altogether, 17,517,490 personnel records—the only comprehensive proof of service for all these Americans—had been wiped out of existence. Some of the most irreplaceable artifacts in world history have been destroyed by fire, from the papyrus scrolls at the Library of Alexandria to a fragment of Jesus’ crown of thorns at Notre-Dame de Paris in 2019. The fire at the National Personnel Records Center wrought a different kind of damage. Few of the individual records that burned held any particular national or global significance. Their primary value to historians was in the aggregate: 17,517,490 tiny bundles of evidence adding up to a thorough picture of Americans’ participation in some of the world’s most devastating conflicts. But even on their own, each of those 17,517,490 files was meaningful to someone—the veteran they represented, a genealogist on a research mission, a writer for whom tiny stories are themselves worth telling. Or a granddaughter, wanting to know more about her grandfather. “Archives are constructed memories about the past, about history, heritage, and culture, about personal roots and familial connections, and about who we are as human beings,” archivist Terry Cook, a key figure in the development of contemporary archive theory, wrote in 2012. “As such, they offer glimpses into our common humanity.” Agonizingly, 50 years on, there’s no easy way to figure out exactly whose files went up in flames. The only way to find out is to request a veteran’s record. A few years ago, I became obsessed with the story of my mother’s father. When I was a child, Grandfather—never Grandpa—took a special interest in me because I loved word games and sports, just like he did. Whenever we visited my grandparents in central Oregon, the two of us would start each day puzzling through the Jumble in The Oregonian. But Grandfather could be gruff; I knew from a young age that he didn’t have much tolerance for personal questions. I was in college when he slipped into dementia, the start of an agonizing six years. He died in 2012. I deeply regret that I never had the opportunity to have an adult conversation with him. There are so many questions I’d do anything to ask. Here’s what I did know: Fritz Ehmann was born in the last week of 1920 to a middle-class Jewish couple in a quiet neighborhood in northern Berlin. One of the few stories I remember him telling me about his childhood involved sneaking into the 1936 Olympic stadium to cheer for American sprinter Jesse Owens, with Hitler watching from a box high above. Two years later, when he was 17, Fritz left Germany. Thanks to his older sister’s husband, a Jewish American State Department employee, he escaped three months before Kristallnacht. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian After an eight-day voyage on the SS Washington, Fritz landed, alone, in New York City in the heat of August. He eventually found his way across the country to Portland, Oregon, where his brother-in-law had family. Midway through Hanukkah, his parents arrived in the United States to join him. Other relatives stayed behind; many died in concentration camps. When the US reinstated its draft in preparation to join the war, young men like my grandfather were initially excluded from serving abroad. After Germany stripped Jews living outside the country of their citizenship in 1941, he was stateless, but to the American government he was still German, and therefore an “enemy alien.” According to historian David Frey, the director of the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at West Point, that changed in March 1942 with the passage of the second War Powers Act, which ruled that German Jews living in the US were eligible to become naturalized citizens—and thus to be drafted into full military service. One artifact my family does have is a photo of my grandfather’s Selective Service card. It shows that he registered for the draft in mid-1942, when he was 21. By then, his name had been anglicized to Fred Ehman. In January 1943, Fred enlisted in the Army. He told my mother that he was conscripted as criminal punishment: He’d missed Portland’s curfew, a common security protocol on the West Coast during the war, and to get the charges dropped, he joined up. To ensure that soldiers had rights in case they were captured, those who weren’t already citizens were naturalized before traveling abroad. So, during basic training in Colorado in August 1943, Fred officially became an American. Grandfather didn’t tell stories about his Holocaust experience as a young boy, or about his time fighting against his homeland and other Axis powers. My mother was pretty sure he served on an aircraft carrier in Southeast Asia—the Air Force was part of the Army until after World War II—but she couldn’t prove it. At some point, Grandfather must have had a copy of his personnel record, but nobody in my family knew what happened to it. And while his experience was dramatic, it wasn’t unique, hardly the stuff of best-selling biographies. I was the only person who was going to put in the work to track down the details. So earlier this year, I filled out a Standard Form 180, “Request Pertaining to Military Records,” seeking any information held by the National Archives about Fritz Ehmann or Fred Ehman. When I submitted the form, it joined a digital queue hundreds of thousands of names long. The coldest storage bays at the National Personnel Records Center are used exclusively for records affected by the 1973 fire. About 11 million records are held in these two bays. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Even Before the flames were extinguished in 1973, the National Archives knew that millions of people like my grandfather would need their files while they were alive, and that exponentially more researchers and family members like me would want them for generations to come. Right away, the agency began working on a plan to preserve as many damaged records as possible. McDonnell Douglas, the St. Louis–based aerospace manufacturer, lent the NPRC its gigantic vacuum chambers; each could dry 2,000 milk crates’ worth of files at a time. Kathy Trieschmann says she and other interns were reassigned to sort through charred records under giant tents in the building’s parking lot to preserve what looked like usable pages—and throw out the rest. Meanwhile, archivists created a new records classification: B files, for “burn.” Those would need to be kept in specialized storage forever. After the rest of the building was deemed safe to use, construction crews simply sheared the demolished sixth story off 9700 Page Avenue and put a new roof over the fifth floor. Finally, in 2010, the government broke ground on a new building to house the center, 15 miles northeast of the original. Applying lessons learned from 1973, the National Archives designed the storage to be as fireproof as possible. Every bay that holds records long-term is temperature- and humidity-controlled; the front of each cardboard file box would fall off in a blaze, covering the metal catwalks that separate each of the four levels so water can’t pass through. The staff moved in in 2011. The newer National Personnel Records Center, just outside of St. Louis. The office receives an average of 4,000 records requests every day—1.1 million a year. Today, when the team receives a request for records from the early 20th century, the first step is to see whether the file exists. If the veteran was in the Navy instead of the Army during World War II, say, or an Air Force sergeant named Howell who served in Korea, the folder will be as pristine as any decades-old paperwork can be. Sgt. Howell’s colleague Sgt. Hutchinson, though, will come up in the database either with no record of a personnel file—meaning nothing remains after the fire—or with the notation “B file.” If the screen says B, it means there is something about Sgt. Hutchinson in one of the two bays designed to hold fire-affected records. The next step is to figure out what condition that something is in. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Plenty of B files can be read with the naked eye; some boxes got damp but suffered no other damage. Others grew mold despite the staff’s best efforts to fend it off—which, when the papers are pulled from cold storage, requires some combination of freezing, dehumidifying, and physically removing spores. There are about 6.5 million B files, far too many to treat proactively, so they remain locked away in the stacks until someone requests the information. Dealing with these fragile records, of course, takes time. As a result, long waits have been a chronic problem for the NPRC ever since the fire (angering politicians from both parties). Then, because few records are digitized, in the early days of the Covid pandemic—when most staff couldn’t work from the office—they fell way, way behind. By March 2022, the backlog hit a new record, with 603,000 outstanding requests. By the following February, staff had cut the pile by a third, to 404,000. With recent additional appropriations, the National Archives and Records Administration plans to resolve the problem by the end of this year. After that, every requester should receive a response within 20 business days. When I visit the National Personnel Records Center in early March, Ashley Cox, who leads a team of preservation specialists, is opening a folder for a World War II lieutenant named William F. Weisnet. When a technician pulls a file, they are often the first person to touch those pages since the immediate aftermath of the fire 50 years ago. Cox, who has a mop of chin-length curls and a nose stud and is wearing a pastel pink hoodie with a Japanese cartoon of a hot dog on the front, thinks of each record she works with as if it were a person under her care. “This particular person got very damaged, and you can go through all the physical therapy ever, but that injury is still going to hurt,” she says, gesturing at Weisnet’s inch-thick file. “So the less that you can aggravate that old injury, the safer it is.” A humidity chamber relaxes curled documents back to flat without stressing the fibers. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian When a B file turns out to have been licked by actual flames, it is categorized on a scale from 1 to 5, from the most lightly affected to the most severely. The edges of each sheet of paper in Weisnet’s folder are slightly blackened, as if someone had run them briefly over a candle before blowing them out, but almost all of the information on the pages is visible. This is a level 1 file, Cox tells me; it won’t need any special treatment before it’s passed along to a technician who will scan it and send a digital copy to the requester. Cox then shows me a much thicker file, with the name Wayne Powell on the front. The pages are deep black and, though Cox is barely touching them, they spit flakes of char onto the table and floor. Many sheets are fused together, forming a dense mass with curled edges. This must be a level 5, I guess. Cox shakes her head. It’s a level 3; if you know where to look, you can pull plenty of information from these pages. Cox can conclusively inform the requester of the dates Powell was in the military, his service number, and—most crucially for benefits purposes—that he was honorably discharged. That might not be enough to satisfy, say, a nosy granddaughter trying to learn everything she can about a grandfather, but it’s plenty of information to prove the basics of Powell’s service record. And that’s what distinguishes NPRC preservation specialists from those at a museum or an academic library: The point of salvaging materials burned in the fire is practical. “It’s a binary proposition: Either you can get something, or there’s nothing,” says Noah Durham, a supervisory preservation specialist in the St. Louis lab who spent the early part of his career working with priceless artifacts at luxury auction houses Christie’s and Sotheby’s, including a second-century BC manuscript by mathematician Archimedes. Tiffany Marshall works with documents in the Records Center’s decontamination lab. Most of the tools the preservation lab uses are decidedly low-tech. Thin painting knives known as microspatulas help separate fused pages without damaging them further. “Bone folders”—small dull tools used in bookbinding, which are now usually made from Teflon or a newly developed polymer called Delrin rather than actual animal bones—are slippery enough to smooth creases and not leave a mark. Where pages are torn, technicians use tweezers to apply pieces of translucent Japanese tissue, which, when heated, mends paper. Down the hall from Cox’s lab, a technician named Elaine Schroeder works in a cubicle that looks entirely banal, with the exception of the tiny pieces of black char scattered everywhere. Picking up a folder labeled with the name Roman Pedrazine, birth date 1899, Schroeder is able to quickly figure out which of the burnt documents she needs for a request. Pedrazine served in the Army Air Forces in both world wars, so his file is 3 inches thick, but Schroeder only needs his final separation document, or DD214. Pulling a Teflon spatula from a pencil cup next to her monitor, she lifts a few pages and reveals the form. The name has burned away, but she can read the service number; it’s the same as the number next to Pedrazine’s name on another page. Match verified, Schroeder turns to digitize the DD214 on a flatbed scanner so a copy can be sent to the requester. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Carol Berry, an archives technician, works on records that became brittle in the fire, assessing them before releasing them for record requests. Occasionally, getting the information requested involves the most extreme option: one of two $80,000 infrared cameras developed specially for the National Archives. Ink absorbs and reflects light differently than plain paper, which means those cameras can often identify words even on a sheet fully blackened by fire. This kind of equipment—most frequently used for “objects of unique significance,” like the ones Durham worked on in the luxury auction world—didn’t even exist a decade ago. Less than 1 percent of records requests require the use of Durham’s infrared cameras; the vast majority of the files kept after the fire were salvaged precisely because they were readable. When Kathy Trieschmann and her fellow interns were, as she recalls, instructed to throw away pages too blackened to read, no one foresaw that four decades later, technology might make those pages decipherable. Infrared imaging is used to identify words on records that were fully blackened by the fire. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Durham, who has wispy, sandy blond hair that stands up from the top of his head, smiles frequently as he describes the technical details of his work. In a darkened room in front of a camera mounted on an adjustable column, he proudly shows me a before-and-after image of a DD214. Part of the page has burned away entirely, and the right half of what remains is almost totally black. On the original copy, I can see that the soldier served during the Korean War, but where he served is obscured. As a scanned version appears on a computer screen behind the camera, the word “Korea” appears next to “theatre of operation.” The date “3 April 52” becomes visible under “medals received.” In a few seconds, the document’s value has transformed, turning proof that the soldier served in the military between 1950 and 1953 into evidence that he was a decorated combat veteran. Durham grins. “It’s a good thing we do.” Around the time I requested Grandfather’s military record, I also submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the FBI to see what I could find out about the devastating blaze. Five decades on, the NPRC fire has been largely forgotten. I wanted to know how it started, and who or what could be blamed for destroying 17,517,490 pieces of 20th-century American history. Within a few weeks, I received a 386-page report that chronicled every step of the two-month FBI investigation. “Scene of fire can’t be reached due to severity of fire, but arson is suspected due to location and rapid break out and rapid spread of fire,” reads one of the first messages from the St. Louis branch (which, coincidentally, maintained an office on the second floor of the NPRC) to then-FBI director Clarence Kelley, who was three days into his job. The last paragraph of the transmission implies a group of suspects: “No employees other than custodians working at location of fire when fire broke out.” Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Soon enough, though, FBI investigators turned their focus to the two dozen interns verifying Vietnam veterans’ records on the first floor. That spring, the US had withdrawn the last of its troops from Vietnam, and anti-war anger remained palpable on college campuses. Just a year earlier, the Weather Underground had detonated a bomb in a Pentagon bathroom. It appears that the FBI didn’t consider it far-fetched to think a 19- or 20-year-old working in the building that held the records of the 3 million people who had been stationed in Vietnam might have been inspired to take a dramatic stand. In the interview reports, almost every name is redacted, but one subject is described as a “hippie type person.” About a week after the fire, two agents showed up at Trieschmann’s house to interview her. They asked her why she went up to the sixth floor when she saw the haze. She told them she was curious. They asked her how she felt about the war and, figuring that lying to the FBI was a bad idea, she told the truth: She opposed it vehemently, believed the US military had committed unforgivable atrocities. But she also didn’t set her workplace on fire. And though she knew many other interns who shared her anti-war principles, she told the FBI, not one would burn service members’ records to dust. They had been working with these files every day for weeks. Many of them had relatives who had served: parents in World War II or Korea, brothers in Vietnam. “From what the FBI said to me, they would have loved if the fire had been started by a radical college student,” Trieschmann remembers. “Except none of the kids were like that.” Even so, there was a reason the FBI was hot on the arson theory: It turns out that the hallways of the NPRC had seen a lot of fires. The previous year, the agency had been notified of four: in a trash can in a men’s restroom on the second floor, in a trash can in a men’s restroom on the first floor, in a trash can in a ladies’ restroom on the fifth floor, and in a trash can in a ladies’ restroom on the fourth floor. “It should be noted,” the missive concluded, “that other minor incidents may have occurred that were not reported.” Sure enough, various employees remembered even more fires, including one in another trash can on the sixth floor, one in a paper towel dispenser, and one in a janitorial closet. One custodian told interviewers that his supervisor had told him about two fires in the previous week alone. Employees were allowed to smoke in the building (though not in the file areas), but that rate of fires resulting from cigarette mishaps is difficult to believe in retrospect. Altogether, the FBI report quotes about 10 people who remembered various fires at the NPRC building in the recent past. Yet within several weeks, agents appear to have essentially given up on trying to find a perpetrator. That may have been in part because the number of suspected arsons in the building seemed to be rivaled only by the number of electrical problems. A custodian who told investigators about multiple fires also said he was constantly finding faulty switches and wires, including eight on the night of July 11 alone. Other employees had observed issues with the giant fans that ventilated file storage areas. One man said he had recently been chided by a colleague for turning on a particular fan on the sixth floor; the wires were exposed and the blades weren’t turning freely. When he went to turn it back off, he noticed a “considerable amount” of smoke coming from the motor and a small pool of oil on the floor. “Do not use,” he wrote on a piece of paper, then taped it to the fan. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian It was also impossible to ignore the fact that in terms of fire safety, the building was a terrible place to keep the only official copy of tens of millions of paper records. Renowned architect Minoru Yamasaki, who would go on to design the original Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, spent several months in the early 1950s studying what to include in a state-of-the-art federal records center. At the time, preservation experts were divided on whether archives should have sprinkler systems, which could malfunction and drown paper records. Yamasaki decided his building would go without. The result, the gleaming glass building on Page Avenue, opened in 1956. More puzzlingly, the architect designed the 728-by-282-foot building—the length of two football fields—with no firewalls in the records storage area to stop the spread of flames. The air conditioning in the file areas, meanwhile, was turned off at night to save money, making the building’s top floor almost unbearably hot after hours. Elliott Kuecker, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina’s School of Information and Library Science, says such decisions look inexplicable in retrospect, but it’s impossible to know for sure what makes sense until after a crisis. “Archivists think about preventative measures as much as possible, but a lot of that has been learned by trial and error and disaster,” he says. Nobody had seen anything. Nobody had named anyone. And the sixth floor was so completely destroyed that it was impossible to investigate fully. The center of the building, where investigators determined the fire began (confirming Trieschmann’s eyewitness account), was buried under multiple tons of concrete and 2 to 3 feet of wet charred rubble from burned records. So eventually, the FBI concluded that the stew of ingredients that led to the disaster was impossible to unblend. The investigation was formally closed in September 1973. A month later, though, something surprising happened: A custodian took the blame. In a signed statement, the man, whose name is redacted, admitted that around 11 pm on July 11, he was in the files on the sixth floor, and he was smoking. He said he extinguished his cigarette by sticking it into an empty bolt hole in the metal shelves, breaking off the lit end, and snuffing out the remaining sparks by wiping them on the side of a shelf. He didn’t know where the match had fallen. When he saw fire trucks arriving as he headed home that night, he assumed it was his fault, but he was afraid to come forward. Until, for some unknowable reason, three months later, he did. The custodian wasn’t arrested, but assistant US attorney J. Patrick Glynn presented the case to a grand jury—not because he was sure an indictment was warranted, according to the FBI report, but to see what jurors could find out from witnesses under oath. The panel, whose records remain sealed, failed to find probable cause for criminal prosecution. The result is that his account has been all but erased from the story of the National Personnel Records Center fire. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian When I visit St. Louis in early March, my first stop is to see Scott Levins, who has directed the NPRC since 2011. Without prompting, he tells me: “I want to make sure you understand you might talk to staff, and someone might say, ‘Oh, I heard it was someone smoking’ or something, but there’s been nothing conclusive.” To this day, the official narrative of July 12, 1973 is that we’ll never know what ignited the blaze. Photographs of the 1973 fire hang in the lobby of the current records center, near St. Louis. As I walk around the preservation lab in St. Louis, burned files everywhere I look, I understand why Levins doesn’t want me focusing on the precise combination of cigarette, negligence, bad luck, and poor design behind the fire. He’s concerned with what he can do about it, with that fleet of highly trained technicians who have dedicated their lives to taking care of the survivors. At the time of my trip, I still had no idea whether my grandfather was one of those survivors, or among the 80 percent of World War II Army veterans whose records were destroyed entirely. After I submitted the Standard Form 180 in January, I got a response within a day. NPRC employees weren’t yet sure whether they had a B file for either Fritz Ehmann or Fred Ehman. I was instructed to complete National Archives Form 13075, with as much information as I could: His Social Security number? His service number? His address when he enlisted? His discharge date? Where did he complete basic training; where was his separation station? What kind of work did he do in the military? Did he ever file a claim for veterans’ benefits or receive a state bonus? I didn’t know how to answer almost any of it. I did the best I could, but a month later, I received an unsatisfying answer. “The information furnished on the enclosed form NA 13075, Questionnaire About Military Service, is insufficient to conduct a search of our alternate records sources. Without any new data, no further search can be made.” They weren’t telling me his record had been destroyed, just that they didn’t know where to look. If I could supply a few additional tidbits of information, though, they might have something to go on. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Because so many files from the first half of the 20th century are gone, the bulk of the NPRC team’s fire-related work is done through these “alternate records sources”—in other words, files that were held by other government departments at the time of the fire. Often, that work starts with a Veterans Administration index card. The cards, with a mix of typewritten text and handwriting, are records of veterans’ claims that were kept—crucially in hindsight—at the VA. Anyone who ever received health care from the VA or took out a low-interest business loan, among other government offerings, has one. These cards don’t look like impressive sources of information; there’s nothing about where the person served, what honors they earned, or even what kinds of benefits they received. But if you know what you’re looking for, preservation team lead Keith Owens tells me, a single card is a treasure trove. It contains a person’s service number, which can be used to track down several other pieces of information—and to determine whether a B file exists. Perhaps most importantly, the very existence of a VA index card means the service member was honorably discharged, the core eligibility requirement for some important benefits, including military burials. Keith Owens, a preservation lead, operates a reel-to-reel microfilm scanner to digitize records. Soon after the fire, the VA turned over more than a thousand rolls of microfilm containing images of each card to the National Archives. Over the past several years, Owens’ team has digitized each card, a process they finally finished in March. But they’re not really digitized in the modern sense of the word. To find a single card, a user must scroll through a file with 1,000 images. Still, Owens or a technician can usually find one—if it exists—within a few minutes. That means the NPRC can answer many, many more requests than ever before. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian Owens, who has spent more than two decades working at the records center, is a burly guy in his early fifties, wearing deliberately distressed jeans with zippers across the thighs. Mostly bald with a short graying beard, he is a trained Baptist minister, and his hearty laugh booms across the lab. Even in an office where everyone is enthusiastic about their work, Owens’ evangelizing sticks out. When he tells me about how it feels to help someone find their records, he scrunches up his eyes. “It gives me hope,” he says. “I just know that what we’re doing now is going to better the possibility of helping somebody. Somebody is going to look at a paper 500 years from now with my name on it and say, Keith Owens, whoever this was, did something amazing to help somebody back then.” Until walking into Owens’ cubicle, I hadn’t planned on bringing up my quest for my grandfather’s records. But under the spell of his pastor’s affect, I babble out the backstory, my voice cracking slightly as I explain that I’d submitted everything I had and it still wasn’t enough. I don’t even know whether Grandfather ever received veterans’ benefits. Owens lights up. Let’s check the index cards and find out, he says. Before I know it, we’re at his computer opening a folder labeled “Egan–Eidson.” We click into a few different PDFs before finding the cards that include the Eh- names. In the fourth one, we find the last name Ehman. We scroll past an Arnold, two Bruces, two Adams, two Alberts, two Andrews. Suddenly, we’re on to Ehmen, with a second “e” where the “a” should be. We scroll down further, until the alphabetization loops back to the start. More Ehmans appear: Charles, Clement, David, Dennis, Earl, Elizabeth. “Come on,” Owens implores, as if willing his favorite sprinter to cross the finish line first. But now we’re back to Ehmen. He sighs, keeps scrolling, keeps narrating. The tone of his voice has turned from excited to apprehensive. I can see the progress bar is almost to the bottom of the file, and my stomach drops. We’re not going to find him. Then, just before we reach the end, I catch a glimpse of “Abraham,” Grandfather’s middle name. “Th- th- th-,” I stammer incomprehensibly, and loudly, fumbling to point him to the right card. Owens reads the name Fred aloud, confirming what I’ve already realized. “Holy shit,” I whisper quietly. “Oh my god.” It’s not like seeing a ghost, exactly, staring at this tiny card with a handful of basic facts about a person I adore and will never see again. It’s more like realizing the person I thought was a ghost is in fact quite visible. But this is just the prelude to my real quest. Now, finally, we can find out whether Grandfather’s personnel record survived the fire. Armed with a service number, we head downstairs to the research room to look for Fred Abraham Ehman. I start to convince myself that I’m one of the lucky ones, that we’ll discover a usable B file with all that detail I’ve been craving, despite the 4-to-1 odds that it’s gone. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian I am not one of the lucky ones. A research specialist in an Adidas hoodie types in the service number, then tells me there’s no listing for a B file. “So that means conclusively that it’s gone?” I ask. “Yes.” My head is spinning so much that I don’t immediately process what he tells me next, which is that there’s a silver lining. What does exist, he says, deep in one of the 15 storage bays in the massive building, is my grandfather’s final pay voucher, or QMP, another alternate records source commonly used to reconstruct information destroyed in the fire. This is actually great news, Keith Owens tells me when I trudge back to his desk. A QMP contains the service member’s date of enlistment, date of discharge, and home address. It lists the reason they were discharged. For someone who served abroad, it even says when they arrived back in the US, and where. If you’re Owens, a man who’s spent two decades trying to help people by getting them any information they can possibly use for benefits, finding a QMP is a moment of triumph. If you’re me, a woman yearning to understand the story of her dead grandfather’s life, it’s a tiny bit heartbreaking. The preservationists were able to find Megan’s grandfather’s final pay stub. The rest of his military file was lost to the fire. Back at my hotel that night, I can’t stop thinking about what might have happened to Grandfather’s record on July 12, 1973. Did it burn away to dust? Was it blackened and thrown away by someone who had no way of knowing that infrared cameras would make it readable five decades later? And, most naggingly: What did it say? I don’t particularly care whether Grandfather earned any medals, and if he had been part of some top-secret military operation, those details aren’t going to be here. By this point, I’ve flipped through enough Official Military Personnel Files that I know they are more disconnected trivia than actual biography. But I can’t help it: I am wild with jealousy of all those people whose relatives’ files are, at this very moment, being tenderly cared for by preservation specialists trained on invaluable pieces of history at Christie’s and Sotheby’s and the greatest universities in the world. Justin Pot Tik Root Parker Hall Alex Christian By the time I arrive at the preservation lab the next morning, Owens has not only scanned that QMP with its facts about Grandfather’s discharge, but kept the original at his desk to show me. Fred Abraham Ehman landed in Washington state on December 28, 1945, four months after the war ended. He was paid $191.68, $50 of it in cash and the rest as a government check. I recognize his signature, with its looping “F” and the lowercase “a” between his first and last names. I touch the paper gently, feeling a heady mix of gratitude and guilt that I don’t feel more gratitude. “Give me a hug,” Owens orders, and I do. By the time I arrive home a few days later, my mood is more sanguine. With all of the information on the QMP, I can figure out which Army unit Grandfather was in, then find the “morning reports” that tracked that unit’s movements around the world. With more work, I can probably track down the vast majority of the same information that burned in 1973, about the refugee turned soldier who became my grandfather. I’ll never know the full story, but I’ve come to accept that even one of those 3-inch-thick B files I’d been coveting wouldn’t have given me that. After the flames raced down the 700-foot-long aisles of the sixth floor, after the columns of smoke rose from the roof like Jack’s beanstalk, after the wind scattered military records around the neighborhoods northwest of St. Louis, after 42 local fire departments battled for days to save one of the largest federal office buildings in the United States, the government spent 50-plus years sorting through the charred remains. Untold numbers of people, meanwhile, spent 50 years, and counting, trying to replace what they lost. Neither project will conclude anytime soon. Let us know what you think about this article.

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Join top executives in San Francisco on July 11-12 and learn how business leaders are getting ahead of the generative AI revolution. Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.\\n\\nTo understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.\\n\\nAnother brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”\\n\\nTwo high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer service\\n\\nHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nDeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.\\n\\nIoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battle\\n\\nMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.\\n\\nAbsolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed.

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Join top executives in San Francisco on July 11-12 and learn how business leaders are getting ahead of the generative AI revolution. Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.\\n\\nTo understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.\\n\\nAnother brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”\\n\\nTwo high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer service\\n\\nHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nDeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.\\n\\nIoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battle\\n\\nMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.\\n\\nAbsolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.\\n\\nA core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.\\n\\nProtecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priority\\n\\nHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.\\n\\nTelesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows.

Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security.

Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls.

Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with.

That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.\\n\\nAbsolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.\\n\\nA core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.\\n\\nProtecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priority\\n\\nHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.\\n\\nTelesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.\\n\\n“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction.

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Join top executives in San Francisco on July 11-12 and learn how business leaders are getting ahead of the generative AI revolution. Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.\\n\\nTo understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.\\n\\nAnother brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”\\n\\nTwo high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer service\\n\\nHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nDeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.\\n\\nIoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battle\\n\\nMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.\\n\\nAbsolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.\\n\\nA core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.\\n\\nProtecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priority\\n\\nHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.\\n\\nTelesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.\\n\\n“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction. He told VentureBeat that customers could gain reassurance from friction that a brand, company or healthcare provider has an advanced understanding of cybersecurity and, most importantly, of the importance of protecting patient data and privacy.',\n",

Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.\\n\\nTo understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.\\n\\nAnother brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”\\n\\nTwo high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer service\\n\\nHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nDeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.\\n\\nIoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battle\\n\\nMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.\\n\\nAbsolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.\\n\\nA core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.\\n\\nProtecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priority\\n\\nHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.\\n\\nTelesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.\\n\\n“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction.

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Join top executives in San Francisco on July 11-12 and learn how business leaders are getting ahead of the generative AI revolution. Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.\\n\\nTo understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.\\n\\nAnother brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”\\n\\nTwo high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer service\\n\\nHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nDeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.\\n\\nIoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battle\\n\\nMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.\\n\\nAbsolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.\\n\\nA core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.\\n\\nProtecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priority\\n\\nHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.\\n\\nTelesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.\\n\\n“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction. He told VentureBeat that customers could gain reassurance from friction that a brand, company or healthcare provider has an advanced understanding of cybersecurity and, most importantly, of the importance of protecting patient data and privacy.',\n",

Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.\\n\\nTo understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.\\n\\nAnother brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”\\n\\nTwo high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer service\\n\\nHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nDeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.\\n\\nIoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battle\\n\\nMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.\\n\\nAbsolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.\\n\\nA core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.\\n\\nProtecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priority\\n\\nHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.\\n\\nTelesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.\\n\\n“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction. He told VentureBeat that customers could gain reassurance from friction that a brand, company or healthcare provider has an advanced understanding of cybersecurity and, most importantly, of the importance of protecting patient data and privacy.',\n",

       "   'content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Join top executives in San Francisco on July 11-12 and learn how business leaders are getting ahead of the generative AI revolution. Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.\\n\\nTo understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.\\n\\nAnother brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”\\n\\nTwo high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer service\\n\\nHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nDeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.\\n\\nIoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battle\\n\\nMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.\\n\\nAbsolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.\\n\\nA core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.\\n\\nProtecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priority\\n\\nHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.\\n\\nTelesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.\\n\\n“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction. He told VentureBeat that customers could gain reassurance from friction that a brand, company or healthcare provider has an advanced understanding of cybersecurity and, most importantly, of the importance of protecting patient data and privacy.',\n",

But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.\\n\\nTo understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.\\n\\nAnother brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”\\n\\nTwo high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer service\\n\\nHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nDeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.\\n\\nIoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battle\\n\\nMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.\\n\\nAbsolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.\\n\\nA core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.\\n\\nProtecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priority\\n\\nHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.\\n\\nTelesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.\\n\\n“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction. He told VentureBeat that customers could gain reassurance from friction that a brand, company or healthcare provider has an advanced understanding of cybersecurity and, most importantly, of the importance of protecting patient data and privacy.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban.

But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin.

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Join top executives in San Francisco on July 11-12 and learn how business leaders are getting ahead of the generative AI revolution. Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine.

And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.\\n\\nTo understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.\\n\\nAnother brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”\\n\\nTwo high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer service\\n\\nHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nDeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.\\n\\nIoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battle\\n\\nMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.\\n\\nAbsolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.\\n\\nA core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.\\n\\nProtecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priority\\n\\nHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.\\n\\nTelesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.\\n\\n“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction. He told VentureBeat that customers could gain reassurance from friction that a brand, company or healthcare provider has an advanced understanding of cybersecurity and, most importantly, of the importance of protecting patient data and privacy.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news.

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Join top executives in San Francisco on July 11-12 and learn how business leaders are getting ahead of the generative AI revolution. Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management.

So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.\\n\\nTo understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.\\n\\nAnother brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”\\n\\nTwo high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer service\\n\\nHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nDeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.\\n\\nIoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battle\\n\\nMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.\\n\\nAbsolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.\\n\\nA core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.\\n\\nProtecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priority\\n\\nHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.\\n\\nTelesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.\\n\\n“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction. He told VentureBeat that customers could gain reassurance from friction that a brand, company or healthcare provider has an advanced understanding of cybersecurity and, most importantly, of the importance of protecting patient data and privacy.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery.

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Join top executives in San Francisco on July 11-12 and learn how business leaders are getting ahead of the generative AI revolution. Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management.

So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.\\n\\nTo understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.\\n\\nAnother brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”\\n\\nTwo high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer service\\n\\nHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nDeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.\\n\\nIoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battle\\n\\nMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.\\n\\nAbsolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.\\n\\nA core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.\\n\\nProtecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priority\\n\\nHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.\\n\\nTelesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.\\n\\n“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction. He told VentureBeat that customers could gain reassurance from friction that a brand, company or healthcare provider has an advanced understanding of cybersecurity and, most importantly, of the importance of protecting patient data and privacy.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery.

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Join top executives in San Francisco on July 11-12 and learn how business leaders are getting ahead of the generative AI revolution. Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management.

So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.\\n\\nTo understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.\\n\\nAnother brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”\\n\\nTwo high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer service\\n\\nHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nDeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.\\n\\nIoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battle\\n\\nMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.\\n\\nAbsolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.\\n\\nA core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.\\n\\nProtecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priority\\n\\nHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.\\n\\nTelesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.\\n\\n“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction. He told VentureBeat that customers could gain reassurance from friction that a brand, company or healthcare provider has an advanced understanding of cybersecurity and, most importantly, of the importance of protecting patient data and privacy.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery.

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Join top executives in San Francisco on July 11-12 and learn how business leaders are getting ahead of the generative AI revolution. Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management.

So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.\\n\\nTo understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.\\n\\nAnother brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”\\n\\nTwo high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer service\\n\\nHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nDeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.\\n\\nIoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battle\\n\\nMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.\\n\\nAbsolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.\\n\\nA core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.\\n\\nProtecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priority\\n\\nHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.\\n\\nTelesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.\\n\\n“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction. He told VentureBeat that customers could gain reassurance from friction that a brand, company or healthcare provider has an advanced understanding of cybersecurity and, most importantly, of the importance of protecting patient data and privacy.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery.

       "   'Content': 'Chipmaker Micron reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the AI tailwinds Micron is riding while highlighting the headwinds semiconductor stocks could still face due to China\\'s cybersecurity bans and rising tension with U.S. regulators.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Shares of Micron trading higher after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. And let\\'s get right into the results with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager. Thanks for your time here today. Just your first impression off this report.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, obviously, it was a good report in regards to revenues and earnings, both of those came in better than expected. I think what everybody is kind of applauding, at least initially on the Micron report, is their projections for the upcoming third quarter. In terms of revenues, they were projecting $3.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. Also some of the comments that came out in the press release from management basically saying that they felt that we had hit a trough, and that revenues were going to hopefully start to improve along with margins going forward.\\n\\nSo I think what everyone\\'s kind of happy about, Jared, is that we\\'re looking for a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to memory, because that sector has been hit particularly hard. And I think that this report gave us some evidence that things are starting to turn here in the second quarter and should start to improve going into the back half of this year.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And I actually have that quote from the CEO. \"We believe that the memory industry has passed its trough in revenue. And we expect margins to improve as industry supply demand balance is gradually restored.\" Could you just talk about in more perhaps general terms the cyclicality of the chip industry? And also, we talk about chips in semiconductors, but they specialize. And Micron, in particular, is levered to the memory side of the equation. Could you just talk about how Micron fits within the industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, you\\'re right, Jared. I mean, if we look at last year, overall revenues in the semiconductor industry were basically flat. This year, this is a projection from the Semiconductor Association-- Industry Association, they\\'re projecting revenues to be down about 11%.\\n\\nIf we look at different sectors within the chip space, about a third of the market are chips that are made for PC, tablets, smartphones. The rest of it is kind of split up between servers and auto and some of these other segments. Now, everybody\\'s gotten very excited about artificial intelligence after that Nvidia report that came out last month. And now, everyone keeps looking for more evidence that artificial intelligence is stimulating revenue growth in the chip space.\\n\\nBut you have to bear in mind, Jared, that memory is a very commodity-based segment. Memory chips go into PC, laptops, and then NAND chips will go into the smartphones. So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Join top executives in San Francisco on July 11-12 and learn how business leaders are getting ahead of the generative AI revolution. Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management.

So it\\'s not the same as, let\\'s say, Nvidia with their Hopper 100 or their Grace Hopper 200 artificial intelligence chips, which are highly specialized. it can command very high prices on the DRAM and NAND chips or memory chips that Micron produces are very commoditized.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, thank you for that. Also, I want to talk about the headwind from China. We\\'ve been talking about the latest push by the administration, what they\\'re floating. And here\\'s a quote, here\\'s another quote from the earnings report from Micron. The recent Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, decision is a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. How much of this is a Micron story versus how it\\'s affecting the entire industry?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, Jared, it is a big story for the entire industry as we heard that this morning with the Nvidia news. But just kind of putting the spotlight back on Micron, if we think about 11% to 12% of their total revenues come from China, about 50% of those revenues will be affected by this potential ban. So it is something that could potentially become a problem going forward. It just depends on whether they can make up sales with the China ban in other markets.\\n\\nNow, Micron with the DRAM and NAND space or memory space, it may be more challenging. Where with Nvidia, because there is such a tremendous demand for their AI chips, they may be able to get over the hurdle of having, for example, the A100 or the A800 chip potentially requiring licensing. That\\'s what they were talking about today out of the Biden administration. They may make it up for sales in other parts of the world.\\n\\nSo it\\'s going to impact different companies differently. But there\\'s no doubt that this is a bad precedent, right? We\\'re getting into this back and forth restrictions between US and China. It\\'s not good for any of the US chip manufacturers, right?\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, exactly. And just getting back to their fourth quarter projections, I\\'m seeing adjusted gross margin. They expect it to be negative 8 to negative 13%. Estimate was for negative 2.79%, so expecting much more negative result in adjusted gross margin. Is this a concern for Micron?\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: You know, Jared, one of the big issues even on this quarter, we were looking for about a $500 million write off on inventory. And they took about a $400 million write-off. Now, we go into the upcoming quarter, and we start to focus on margins. What that basically means is they\\'re not getting as much for the memory chips that they\\'re selling in terms of their bottom line profit.\\n\\nSo I think this is something to take a look at. We know that top line revenue number was above expectations for the upcoming quarter. But obviously, this will hopefully get a better explanation in regards to margins, why they seem to be below the street on the upcoming third quarter. And as you mentioned earlier, Jared, in the beginning of our conversation, in the press release, they talked about margins should begin to improve. So be a little bit more color on why we\\'re not seeing that versus expectations on this upcoming quarter.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: We got under a minute. Anything we didn\\'t touch on here that you\\'d like to share.\\n\\nDANIEL MORGAN: Well, again, each chip company is different. Micron is going to be a different play than an Nvidia or some of these other companies that are going to more broadly be affected by AI. In the long term, we expect memory increases associated with AI. But it\\'s harder to see it in the next quarter or two, where we might get a bigger impact from some of the other companies that we\\'ve been talking about.\\n\\nJARED BLIKRE: All right. Thank you for keeping that short. And we always appreciate your time. Daniel Morgan.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'Join top executives in San Francisco on July 11-12 and learn how business leaders are getting ahead of the generative AI revolution. Learn More\\n\\nHealthcare providers must look beyond the cloud and adopt zero-trust security to succeed in fighting back against the onslaught of breaches their industry is experiencing.\\n\\nAttackers often prey on gaps in network servers, incorrectly configured cloud configurations, unprotected endpoints, and weak to non-existent identity management and privileged access security. Stealing medical records, identities and privileged access credentials is a high priority for healthcare cyberattackers. On average, it takes a healthcare provider $10.1 million to recover from an attack. A quarter of healthcare providers say a ransomware attack has forced them to stop operations completely.\\n\\nHealthcare must build on cloud security with zero trust\\n\\nForrester’s recent report, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023, provides an insightful look at how healthcare providers are fast-tracking their cloud adoption with the hope of getting cybersecurity under control. Eighty-eight percent of global healthcare decision-makers have adopted public cloud platforms, and 59% are adopting Kubernetes to ensure higher availability for their core enterprise systems. On average, healthcare providers spend $9.5 million annually across all public cloud platforms they’ve integrated into their tech stacks. It’s proving effective — to a point.\\n\\nWhat’s needed is for healthcare providers to double down on zero trust, first going all-in on identity access management (IAM) and endpoint security. The most insightful part of the Forrester report is the evidence it provides that continuing developments from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud are hitting the mark with healthcare providers. Their combined efforts to prove cloud platforms are more secure than legacy network servers are resonating.\\n\\nEvent Transform 2023 Join us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. Register Now\\n\\nThat’s excellent news for the industry, as the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal shows that in the last 18 months alone, 458 healthcare providers have been breached through network servers, exposing over 69 million patient identities.\\n\\nThe HHS portal shows that this digital pandemic has compromised 39.9 million patient identities in the first six months of 2023, harvested from 298 breaches. Of those, 229 resulted from successful hacking, 61 from unauthorized access/disclosure, and the remainder from theft of medical records. Business email compromise (BEC) and pretexting are responsible for 54 breaches since January, compromising 838,241 patients’ identities.\\n\\nConsidered best-sellers on the Dark Web, patient medical records provide a wealth of data for attackers. Cybercrime gangs and globally organized advanced persistent threat (APT) groups steal, sell and use patient identities to create synthetic fraudulent identities. Attackers are getting up to $1,000 per record depending on how detailed the identity and medical data are.\\n\\nLessons from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which showed the increasing fragility of digital trust, must also be applied to healthcare.\\n\\nImproving security motivates healthcare providers to adopt public cloud platforms, tempered by privacy concerns. The healthcare industry must aim higher and address high-risk threat vectors starting with endpoints and better identity, access and privileged access management. Source: Forrester, The State of Cloud in Healthcare, 2023\\n\\nTurning weaknesses into strengths with zero trust\\n\\nForrester concludes that healthcare providers are prime targets for attackers because they use outdated legacy technologies, especially when storing sensitive patient data. That weakness is magnified by the urgency of getting critical care to patients.\\n\\n“Threat actors are increasingly targeting flaws in cyber-hygiene, including legacy vulnerability management processes,” Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti, told VentureBeat.\\n\\nIn fact, Ivanti’s Press Reset: A 2023 Cybersecurity Status Report found that all organizations are behind in protecting against ransomware, software vulnerabilities, API-related attacks and software supply chain attacks. Ivanti’s research results underscore why zero trust needs to become an urgent priority in all healthcare organizations, given that many lag behind peers in other industries on these core dimensions.\\n\\nForrester observed that “CISOs may be reluctant to trust the public cloud, but outsourcing to a multitenant platform can benefit healthcare providers with military-grade AES 256 data encryption that helps prevent data exposure and theft. Global hyperscalers offer compliant instances and consulting services to help meet regulatory compliance. Similarly, EHR systems such as Oracle Cerner and Epic Systems are now offering cloud-based offerings/partnerships.”\\n\\nEvery healthcare provider needs a zero-trust roadmap tailored to its greatest threats\\n\\nThe goal is to become more resilient over time without breaking budgets or asking for major investments from the board. An excellent place to start is with a zero-trust roadmap. There are a few standard documents CISOs and CIOs running healthcare IT and cybersecurity should use to tailor zero-trust security to their unique business challenges.\\n\\nThe first is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). The NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CSWP), Planning for a Zero Trust Architecture: A Guide for Federal Administrators, describes processes for migrating to a zero-trust architecture using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\\n\\nSecond, John Kindervag, who created zero trust while at Forrester and currently serves as senior vice president, cybersecurity strategy and ON2IT group fellow at ON2IT Cybersecurity, and Dr. Chase Cunningham were among several industry leaders who wrote the useful President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Draft on Zero Trust and Trusted Identity Management. The document defines zero-trust architecture as “an architecture that treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.”\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a hub of the President’s NSTAC Publications, providing a valuable index of the committee’s body of work.\\n\\nProliferating ransomware attacks underscore the need to enforce least privileged access across every threat surface\\n\\n“We know that bad guys, once they’re in the network and compromise [it], the first [breached] machine can move laterally to the next machine, and then the next machine, and the next machine. So once they’ve figured that out, the chances of you having a ransomware breach and having data exfiltrated from your environment increase,” Drex DeFord, executive strategist and healthcare CIO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) provides a series of Threat Briefs that healthcare CISOs and CIOs should consider subscribing to and staying current with. The depth of analysis and insight the HCS puts into these briefs is noteworthy.\\n\\nTo understand the scale of healthcare providers’ challenges with ransomware, VentureBeat also recommends reading the June 8, 2023 presentation, Types of Threat Actors That Threaten Healthcare.\\n\\nAnother brief reveals how nation-state attacks are among the most sophisticated and challenging to stop: the November 3, 2022 Threat Brief titled “Iranian Threat Actors and Healthcare.”\\n\\nTwo high priorities, according to CISOs: a compromise assessment, and a subscription to an incident response retainer service\\n\\nHealthcare providers and supporting organizations need a clear baseline across all systems to verify that their existing IT environments and tech stacks are clean. “When you have a compromise assessment done, [getting] a comprehensive look at the entire environment and [making] sure that you’re not owned, and you just don’t know it yet, is incredibly important,” DeFord told VentureBeat during an interview.\\n\\nDeFord and other CISOs interviewed for this article also advise healthcare CISOs to get an incident response retainer service if they don’t already have one. “That makes sure that should something happen, and you do have a security incident, you can call someone, and they will come immediately,” DeFord advises.\\n\\nIoT, edge computing and connected medical devices make endpoint security a constant battle\\n\\nMost legacy IoT sensors, the machines attached to them, and medical devices aren’t designed with security as a primary goal. That’s why attackers love these devices. Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at cybersecurity company Ivanti, says business leaders must realize the cost of managing endpoints, IoT and medical devices by continually improving security. “Organizations must continue moving toward a zero-trust model of endpoint management to see around corners and bolster their security posture,” Mukkamala told VentureBeat.\\n\\nAbsolute Software’s 2023 Resilience Index shows that the average endpoint has 11 different security agents installed, each degrading at a different rate and creating memory conflicts. This leaves the endpoint unprotected and vulnerable to a breach. Overloading endpoints with too many agents is just as bad as having none installed. CISOs and CIOs in healthcare need to audit every endpoint agent installed and find out if and how they conflict with each other.\\n\\nA core part of the audit is knowing which identities have access rights for each endpoint, including third-party contractors and suppliers. Captured audit data is invaluable in setting least privileged access policies that strengthen zero trust on every endpoint.\\n\\nProtecting patient identities requires making zero trust a priority\\n\\nHealthcare CISOs are under pressure to ensure their IT and cybersecurity investments deliver business value. One of the most valuable assets any healthcare provider has is patient trust. More healthcare providers need to consider how to create secure customer experiences with zero trust.\\n\\nTelesign CEO Joe Burton told VentureBeat that while customer experiences vary significantly depending on their digital transformation goals, it is essential to design cybersecurity and zero trust into customer workflows. That’s excellent advice for healthcare providers under siege by attackers today.\\n\\n“Customers don’t mind friction if they understand that it’s there to keep them safe,” Burton said, adding that machine learning is an effective technology for streamlining the user experience while balancing friction. He told VentureBeat that customers could gain reassurance from friction that a brand, company or healthcare provider has an advanced understanding of cybersecurity and, most importantly, of the importance of protecting patient data and privacy.',\n",
